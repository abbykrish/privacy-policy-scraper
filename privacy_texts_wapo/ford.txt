In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain web beacons used to determine the effectiveness and track your interaction with that content. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.    For example, many of our websites use Mouseflow, a third-party analytics tool, to track page content and click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity. You can find more information on Mouseflow’s privacy practices at https://mouseflow.com/privacy/ or opt-out at https://mouseflow.com/privacy/ . https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/ .

To learn about how Google uses and shares data it collects through these services, we encourage you to visit https://www.google.com/privacy.html and https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ .    Interest-Based Advertising    As noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and cookie identifiers). We may also share such information we have collected with Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford websites and online services, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) sites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or “online behavioral advertising.”    Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices in the footer of the page.

The current user or users have the opportunity to allow or refuse your connection to the vehicle.    Additionally, you can turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass/Lincoln Way account by performing a MASTER RESET or by removing the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way App garage. To learn how to perform a MASTER RESET , please see your owner’s manual. Deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing. See Connected Vehicle Controls (above) for more information.    Some vehicles have in-vehicle pop-up notifications to alert drivers and passengers of Connected Vehicle Information sharing settings (see “How to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data” above). Drivers with an unrecognized mobile device may see a pop-up displayed in-vehicle informing them of the current vehicle data and/or location sharing settings. A mobile device is “recognized” if it has been paired with an infotainment system, like SYNC. This way if someone is new to the vehicle, or not driving it enough to pair their mobile device, the system will inform them of the vehicle’s current data and/or location sharing settings.    CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS    California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)    If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the CCPA, you have certain rights with respect to that information:    Access/Right to Know. You have a right to request that we provide you with the following information:     The categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months.  The categories of sources from which we collect personal information.  The purposes for collecting, using, or selling personal information.  The categories of third parties with which we share personal information.  The categories of personal information we have disclosed about you for a business purpose. Note that the CCPA defines “business purpose” broadly; and because we use service providers for a number of business purposes that require access to our systems that hold personal information (such as supplying cloud data storage, maintaining the security of our systems, and providing customer support), in the past 12 months we have disclosed for a business purpose data from all of the categories of personal information that we maintain.  The categories of personal information we have sold about you for each category of third party to which the personal information was sold. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this Policy may be considered a “sale” under that definition. We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.     In the past 12 months, we have shared personal information with others for commercial purposes or their independent uses as follows:    - SIRIUS XM. We share Contact Information from vehicle sales with SIRIUS where the purchaser is eligible for a complimentary satellite radio trial.  - Advertising and Analytics Companies. We share Device Details and Network information, Digital Activity, Preferences, Demographics, Device and Mobile Location  - Joint Marketing Partners and Dealers. We share the following information with partners and dealers for co-branded service offerings or joint marketing activities:  Contact Information, Demographics, Preferences, Inferred preferences, Content of Communications, Vehicle Service History, Device Details and Network information, and Digital Activity.    Right to Delete. You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.    Right to Opt-Out From Sales. You also have a right to opt-out from future sales of personal information, which you can exercise by clicking on the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” button on our website. See also the Cookies section of this Policy to learn how to opt out of analytics and ad targeting.    How to Exercise Your California CCPA Rights    You can exercise your CCPA rights by submitting your request(s) to us using the web form located at www.ford.com/help/privacy/ccpa or www.lincoln.com/help/privacy/ccpa . You can also exercise your CCPA rights by calling us, toll-free, at 1-888-459-1291, Monday through Friday from 5:00 am until 8:00 pm Pacific time or Saturday from 5:00 am until 5:00 pm Pacific time.

Please be aware that we will process your requests in the order we receive them.    Whether you use the web form or call us, we will need information from you to process your request so that we can confirm you are a California resident, determine if we have personal information about you, and, for access and deletion requests, verify your identity. We may also need to contact you about your request, and you can choose the contact method you would like us to use.    Please be aware there might be circumstances where we will not honor your request, as permitted under the CCPA. For example, if we are not able to verify your identity and that you are a California resident, we may not honor your access or deletion request. In addition, we may not delete your personal information if an exception under the CCPA applies.    You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.    If you want an authorized agent to submit a “Delete My PI” or “Access My PI” request on your behalf, the authorized agent must provide proof of their registration with the California Secretary of State, as well as proof that you gave the authorized agent written permission to submit the request(s) on your behalf. We may also require you to verify your identity with us.    If you want an authorized agent to submit a “Do Not Sell My PI” instruction on your behalf, the authorized agent must provide proof of their registration with the California Secretary of State, as well as proof that you gave the authorized agent written permission to submit the instruction on your behalf.    You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising rights set out in the CCPA.    California Shine the Light    Additionally, under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses.

RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION    We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful business purposes.

When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of personal data protections, please visit: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en .    SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION    Safeguarding personal information is important to us. While no systems, applications, or websites are 100% secure, we take reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.    To help us protect personal information, we request that you use a strong password and never share your password with anyone or use the same password with other sites or accounts.
