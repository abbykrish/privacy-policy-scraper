This includes information you provide when you: create an account with us; subscribe to our Services or publications; make a reservation through our Services; request marketing to be sent to you; or give us feedback. Using Our Services: As you interact with our Services, we may automatically collect Technical Data and Usage Data about your use of our Services. Some of the ways in which we may collect information are further described below: Cookies and other technologies: The Services may use cookies, a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a website user’s computer or other device to permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using that computer or device. The Services may use other similar technologies (including, without limitation, tracking pixels, as described further below, and other anonymous identifiers) to gather information about you, such as IP addresses and location data, to customize your visit, to enable us to enhance our Services, or for other purposes. Please see our Cookie Policy located on the Resy.com homepage for further details. Interest-Based Advertising: We may engage third-party vendors to use your information in connection with their own information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit our website or other websites. Cookies, described above, may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising is called "Behavioral Advertising." We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see ads that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt out of these interest-based advertisements, please see the “CUSTOMER CHOICES” section below. Clickstream Data: When you use the internet, websites collect information about the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the website. The Services may collect and use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our website, how visitors navigate throughout the website and how we may tailor our website to better meet the needs of visitors. This information may be used to improve our Services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregated and will not intentionally contain any information about you. Location Data: When you give us consent, we will collect the latitude and longitude coordinates of your device when you are searching restaurant availability.

To our affiliates, such as the American Express family of companies. To third-party service providers to provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your information as part of providing those services for us.

In some circumstances we may anonymize information about you (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use and retain this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR EU RESIDENTS Personal Data Some of the data that we collect from individuals in the European Union may identify or be identifiable to an individual.   This information is considered “personal data” in the European Union, and subject to additional protections. Legal basis for our processing of your personal data Below are the types of lawful bases that we will rely on to process your personal data: Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject. With your consent. Change of purpose We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. Collection of personal data from third-party sources We also collect personal data about you from various third parties and public sources. If you register for our Services using Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites, we will import your information from those social media sites. When a new restaurant joins us, we will collect any information that restaurant has about prior guests and import it into the restaurant's guestbook on our Services. We also obtain information about you from restaurants who partner with us, including notes, tags, and other metadata about your dining habits and experiences. As discussed above, we also obtain information through cookies and similar technologies (see “INFORMATION COLLECTION” section). Withdrawing your consent If we are relying on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at privacy@resy.com. Use of your personal data for marketing purposes We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising: Promotional offers from us: We may use your personal data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or used our services and have not opted out of receiving that marketing. For the EU, you must opt in to receive marketing communications. Third-party marketing: We will get your consent before we share your personal data with any company outside our company for marketing purposes. To see how you can opt out of marketing communications, please see the “CUSTOMER CHOICES” section. Rights of EU data subjects Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to: Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. If you are situated in the EU and have any complaints regarding our privacy practices as a data controller or want to exercise your rights, please contact us please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@resy.com. You may also contact the local Supervisory Authority or seek legal remedies. Additionally, if you would like a restaurant to delete information it as collected about you, we encourage you to contact the restaurant directly. If you are unsuccessful in reaching the appropriate contact at the restaurant, please contact us at privacy@resy.com and we will do our best to connect you with the right person who can help you.
