Visa Cookie Notice Effective date:  January 1, 2020  This notice explains Visa’s approach to cookies and other online data collection technologies.  When you visit our websites, use our mobile apps, engage with our online ads or emails, we collect information, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons), browser analysis tools and server logs. Each of these technologies is explained below.  1. How We Use Cookies  We use cookies and other online data collection tools for several many different purposes.  Strictly necessary cookies and tags are used by Visa to support the basic operations of our websites and apps. They enable core website functions, such as authentication, security, network management and accessibility. You may be able to disable these by changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the website functions.  Performance and operation cookies and tags are used by us and our service providers to manage our websites. These activities may include collecting analytics about visitors to our website and collecting information about website usage. We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the website. These cookies help us gather data to optimize our website’s performance.  Site experience cookies and tags are used to support your experience and include user-selected options and site navigation aids.  Marketing and personalization cookies are used to enable social sharing and to deliver interest-based ads to you online.  Social media cookies and tags used by us and social media platforms to enable users of the platforms to share content across our sites. We also work with social media platforms to deliver ads to you when you use these platforms. This targeting is done by the platform under its own terms of use.  Advertising cookies and tags used by us, our service providers and third parties to personalize the ads delivered to you on our site and on other sites. These cookies collect data about your online activity and allow ads to be displayed that may be of relevant interest to you. These cookies also record which ads you have seen and whether you engaged with the ad. These cookies help make sure that the ads you see are valuable to you and not repetitive.  While we do not give any personally identifiable information to the third-party advertising companies, we may place third-parties’ cookies and tags when you visit a Visa website. This practice allows these third parties to collect information from you using these technologies on our websites. The information they collect is subject to their own privacy policies.  Uses of cookies can vary by country or state. More information is provided in the supplemental privacy notices posted in the Privacy Center or in the relevant website or app.  2. Your Choices  For websites in the United States and Europe, Visa provides you with the ability to manage cookies that are not essential to display our website using “Manage Your Cookies” Many Visa websites only place marketing, personalization, and advertising cookies if you explicitly accept these cookies by clicking “Accept All Cookies” when you first visit the website. If you have accepted cookies, you adjust your preferences by using this link.  You can manage cookies and delete cookies from Visa and other companies using your browser settings. Browsers such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari give you the ability to accept, reject or delete cookies. Visit the “help center” for your browser to learn more. Please note that your browser settings are not used to manage Flash or Silverlight cookies. To manage Adobe Flash Cookies, visit the Flash Player help page . To manage Microsoft Silverlight Cookies, visit the Silverlight section of Microsoft’s privacy statement .  You can also take advantage of industry-sponsored programs that allow you to control the way companies advertise to you.  The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) manages an opt-out program for many third-party advertising companies. You can opt out of being targeted by NAI members by visiting https://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp .  On some websites, you may see an AdChoices icon, which may appear on certain targeted ads. You may click on this AdChoices icon to learn more information about the collection and use of your information or to opt-out of such collection in the future. To learn more about the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice tool, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info .  Additional information on cookies and online advertising choices are offered by:  Adobe Marketing Cloud: If you would like more information on how to remove yourself from the tracking and reporting functions performed for this website by Adobe Marketing Cloud, please visit the Opt-Out page at http://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html .  Google: For information on how Google Analytics uses data please visit “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps,” located at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners .  In most cases, the choices you make are linked to your browser. If you use different browsers or different devices, you will need to set your preferences on each one. Even if you opt-out, you may still receive ads that are not customized for you, unrelated to your browser settings.  Although our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize the various web browser Do Not Track signals, we do offer our customers choices to manage their cookie preferences as described in the previous section. To learn more about browser tracking signals and Do Not Track please visit https://allaboutdnt.com/ .  Residents of some countries and states have additional privacy rights. Information on these rights is provided in the supplemental privacy notices posted in the Privacy Center .  3. Social Media and other Platforms  Our websites may enable you to interact with us and others via social media platforms. This functionality is enabled using social media cookies and tags. For example, some Visa websites allow you to sign in using social media platform credentials. Please read the privacy statements provided by your social media platforms to understand how they use your information and to manage your choices.  We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using social media platforms. These platforms allow us to personalize the ads that we display to you. To enable delivery of these ads, we convert your email address into a unique number. The platforms also convert their user emails into unique numbers using the same process. This allows the records to be matched without any exchange of data elements that can identify you on their own. The platforms perform the matching as a service provider to Visa, and they do not retain or use the file that we send them for their own purposes. This process allows the platform to deliver our ads to our customers on the platform. The platforms may gain insights about individuals who respond to the ads we serve.  4. Other Types of Online Data Collection  Our server logs record information about users to our websites. We may use these logs for internal purposes, such as website administration, optimization and security. We may also use the data for fraud-protection, personalization and advertising.  We collect device identifiers and other device-related information, including your device’s advertising ID if available. This information is used to identify the device and authenticate you. We may also use device-related information to associate you with different devices that you may use, including for fraud-protection purposes and to better target advertising. In many cases, you can reset your device’s advertising ID. Both Android and iOS devices enable you to reset your device identifier under the “settings” menu.  5. A Guide to Cookies and Other Technologies  Cookies  Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a customized experience and can enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud.  First-party cookies are those cookies that are placed by Visa. These cookies are used by Visa and include all the essential cookies.  Third-party cookies are placed by another company, including service providers, social media cookies and third-party advertising companies. Cookies placed by third parties can be read by these third parties when you visit other sites in the advertising network, allowing a profile of your online behavior to be created so that the third party can deliver targeted ads from all its customers.  Flash Cookies and Silverlight Cookies  A Flash Cookie (also known as a Local Stored Object) is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology. A Silverlight Cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Microsoft’s Silverlight technology. Flash and Silverlight are applications that allow delivery of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation. These cookies are used to personalize and enhance your online experience, deliver dynamic content, and for security purposes. They differ from “regular cookies” in that they are not managed using your browser settings. See Your Choices above for how to manage these types of cookies.  Pixel Tags and Web Beacons  Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are tiny graphic images and small blocks of code placed on website pages, ads, or in emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access the pages or you open an email, the tag lets us know you have accessed the web page or opened the email. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.  Server Logs  Server logs record activities on our websites. Other types of logs collect similar information from our apps. These logs record information about the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. Our logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices require to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to Visa and the website you visit after you leave our site.

At Visa, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of all the personal information that is entrusted to us. Visa has a Global Privacy Program to help ensure your information is handled properly, and your personal information is protected. It also reflects the requirements of the privacy laws in all the countries and states where Visa operates. Our Global Privacy Notice describes our privacy and security practices in detail.  In the United States, the payment transaction information that Visa collects when it operates its payment networks is regulated by existing federal financial privacy laws. The CCPA recognizes that such financial information is already protected by federal privacy law, so the CCPA does not apply to this information. Visa’s privacy program reflects the sensitivity of the financial and other information we handle. If you have questions about how we handle your Visa payment card data, please visit Additional Privacy Information and review the section on Card Transaction Data .  Beyond financial information, Visa does collect certain information that is subject to the CCPA. The CCPA applies (1) to our marketing data, which we collect when consumers sign up for marketing from Visa, attend Visa-sponsored events, or interact with our websites and apps, and (2) to information collected from individuals who use Visa (formerly Visa Checkout) and other Visa Solutions secure checkout services. This supplemental privacy notice explains our practices for this CCPA-covered information.                               As a global payments technology company, Visa fulfills many roles. When we act as a service provider for Visa card issuers and merchants, we only collect and use personal information as authorized by our contracts with our clients. If you have questions about how these companies handle your personal information, or wish to exercise your rights, please contact them directly. For example, if you have signed up for cash-back or loyalty offers with your financial institution or a merchant, please contact that company for more information.                                                  CCPA Rights              The CCPA provides California residents with specific privacy rights, including the right to receive a privacy notice, the right to know what information we have collected about you during the past 12 months and the right to know what categories of personal information we have shared with third parties. CCPA gives California residents the right to opt-out of having their personal information sold¹. CCPA also gives California residents the right to request deletion of their personal information.  For information that Visa collects subject to the CCPA, this notice describes the categories of information that we collect from California residents generally, the sources of the information, the purposes for which we use the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose the information for business purposes. Visa does not sell personal information .  As described below, Visa may share personal information with its Affiliates² and service providers. We may also disclose personal information to third parties for business purposes as permitted by CCPA, such as to our auditors, for compliance or security, or in connection with mergers and acquisitions.  We may also share personal information with third parties based on your consent, such as if you enroll in a co-branded marketing program or if you explicitly accept our use of third-party advertising cookies, as described in our Cookie Notice .                          ¹ Personal information of children under 16 cannot be sold without affirmative consent.

We will respond to requests using the email address that is associated with the information we maintain.  If you would like to designate an agent, please send an email from your own email address to privacy@visa.com indicating the name and email address of your agent. We will respond to that’s person’s requests using both your email address and the agent’s email address.  Please understand that your rights are subject to some limitations:   For security reasons and to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information, cardholders should contact their payment card issuers to access their Card Transaction Data. This helps ensure that access to the information is only provided to the authorized individuals, subject to the issuer’s verification processes.  CCPA provides that service providers should refer access and deletion requests to the companies with whom the individual has the direct relationship. In many cases, we act as a service provider for card issuers and merchants, including rewards networks. If you have questions about how your issuer or a rewards network handles your personal information, please check the privacy notices provided by these companies and contact them directly for assistance with your relevant privacy requests.  CCPA also prohibits companies from including certain elements of sensitive personal information, such as payment card number, in their access reports, even if you have provided those data elements to use for marketing.  If you request that we delete your personal information, we will do so except in those situations where our retention is required for our internal business purposes or otherwise permitted by CCPA (such as for fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these situations, we will retain your information in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.                               Financial Incentives              Visa collects personal information in order to deliver offers and promotions and to enable loyalty programs. While we cannot calculate the precise value of your information to us, our offers and incentives generally reflect the value of the relationships that we have with the individuals who participate in the program.  We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under CCPA. However, if you ask us to delete your information, you will not be able to receive additional offers or promotions for which the deleted information was needed for program participation. Any offers or promotions sent to you previously will continue to be honored according to their original terms.
