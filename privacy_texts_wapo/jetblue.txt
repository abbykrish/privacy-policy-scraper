In-App Tracking Methods: There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.

We use analytics services, such as Adobe and Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the JetBlue Services. In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we may place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.  As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into JetBlue Services (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“ Interest-based Advertising ”).  We also use audience matching services to reach people (or similar people) who have visited the JetBlue Services or are identified in one or more of our databases (“ Matched Ads ”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or incorporating a pixel from a technology service into JetBlue Services, and the technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For instance, we may incorporate the Facebook pixel on the JetBlue Services and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences. Some technology services may provide us with their own data, which is then uploaded into another technology service for matching common factors between those datasets.  As indicated above, vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.  For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the JetBlue Services and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, and Matched Ads, please see the “Information Collected Automatically” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections.  6. Collection and Use of Biometric Data. Certain of the JetBlue services, including without limitation the JetBlue Services, may collect personal information about you that includes biometric data, such as fingerprints, digital photographs, retinal scans, facial recognition data and other biometric information (collectively, “Biometric Data”).  We may collect this Biometric Data using technological means, such as identification document scanners, fingerprint scanners, digital cameras, retinal scanners and facial recognition scanners, either in person at our business locations or via your device.  Biometric Data may be used by JetBlue solely for identity verification purposes to: (1) facilitate and expedite airport processes, such as check-in and boarding; (2) prevent fraud and misrepresentation; (3) enhance security at designated customs and security checkpoints; and (4) comply with applicable laws and regulations, including Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) requirements.  For instance, JetBlue may use a biometric enabled boarding process, which converts a photograph to a digital image that is used for identity verification purposes and which may be shared with CBP upon boarding an international flight as part of CBP’s biometric exit program. For more information on this program, visit https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics .  In each case, we only use these technologies with your express consent and as permitted by applicable law.  JetBlue manages the security and confidentiality of Biometric Data to protect it from unauthorized access, use, disclosure or alteration.  JetBlue will not use your Biometric Data for marketing purposes or share your Biometric Data with third parties for such third parties’ own marketing purposes.  JetBlue complies with all local privacy laws in the collection and processing of Biometric Data.  7.

JetBlue does not knowingly collect personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or “COPPA”) in a manner not permitted by COPPA.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever. If you are a parent or legal guardian and you believe we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us through one of the methods set forth in the “Contact Us” section below.  We will remove the data to the extent required by applicable laws.

To make a request, contact us as set out in “Contact Us” section with “California Under 18 Content Removal Request” in the subject line, and a description of the information you want removed.  We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the information from prospective public view, although we cannot ensure the complete or comprehensive removal of the content and may retain the content as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  8. Security of Collected Information. We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical precautions to keep information about you obtained in connection with the JetBlue Services secure against unauthorized access and use, and we periodically review our security measures. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you outside our control.  When you affirmatively provide us with information such as your name, address, phone number, credit card information, travel details, etc. while registering with TrueBlue or making a reservation or engaging with a feature of our offered web services, your information is encrypted and transferred over a secure connection, available on most internet browsers.  Please note that if you provide information outside of a secure session, JetBlue cannot guarantee that information is protected with appropriate safeguards.

B. Tracking Technologies.   Cookies and Pixels. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.  Do Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com .  App and Location Technologies. You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. You can stop all collection of precise location data through an app by uninstalling the app or withdrawing your consent through your device settings.   Please be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the JetBlue Services may not function correctly.  C. Analytics and Internet-based Advertising.  The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads.  Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”).  To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices ; (ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices ; and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ . Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).  You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).

Roles  Data protection laws in the European Union distinguish between organizations that process personal information for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal information on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”).  JetBlue acts as a controller with respect to the personal information it holds about you.  B. Legal Bases  Data protection laws in the European Union require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data.  JetBlue’s legal bases include: (1) processing personal information about you in order to fulfill our contractual obligation to you, including providing you with flights, for schedule change notifications, and to administer your True Blue account; (2) using and disclosing personal information we hold about you as required for legal compliance, including required disclosures to the TSA or other governmental agencies; (3) processing personal information we hold about you where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, such as to prevent fraud and improve our customer service; and (4) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers, partners, or customers.  C. Your Data Subject Rights  If you are a data subject in the Europe Union, under certain conditions, you may have the right to require us to:   provide you with further details on the use we make of personal information about you  provide you with a copy of the personal information we hold about you  update any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold about you  delete any of personal information we hold about you that we no longer have a lawful ground to use  where processing is based on consent, stop that particular processing by withdrawing your consent  object to any processing based on our legitimate interests unless our reasons for undertaking that processing outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights  restrict how we use personal information about youwhilst a complaint is being investigated  transfer personal information we hold about you to a third party in a standardized machine-readable format   In certain circumstances, we may need to restrict your rights in order to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests.  We are obliged to keep personal information we hold about you accurate and up to date. Please help us to do this by advising us of any changes to such personal information.  If you wish to exercise any of the rights above, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section above.  In the request, please specify what kind of request you are seeking to make and the scope of the request.  We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests.  D. Cross Border Transfers of Your Personal Information  The global nature of our business means that your personal information may be transferred across national boundaries, including, potentially, to countries that do not require organizations by law to look after your personal information in the way in which you have come to expect in your own country.  Where we transfer personal information about you across national boundaries, we will protect such personal information by ensuring that those transfers are made in compliance with all relevant data protection laws.  Generally, this means where we transfer your personal information to a third party that is located in a country which does not have adequate privacy protection, we will put in place a contract with the third party that includes the standard international data transfer contractual terms approved by the European Commission.  If you would like further details of how your personal information is protected when transferred from one country to another then please contact us.  E. Your Right to Complain  If you have a complaint about our use of personal information about you or response to your requests regarding such personal information, then you have the right to complain to the authority that supervises our processing of your personal information or, where you are based in the European Union, the data protection authority in your country.  We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us by contacting us as set out in the “Contact Us” section above.
