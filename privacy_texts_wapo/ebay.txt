Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) introduced new data privacy rights for Californians, including the right for residents to request that businesses do not ‘sell’ their personal information (also called “Opt-Out”). This new definition of ‘selling’ data expands upon the prior meaning to include several forms of common sharing practices. There are many good reasons why eBay shares personal information with certain third parties in which sharing could fall under this new definition, such as for identifying and preventing fraud and theft throughout our industry, or for tailoring and improving your overall online experience. Another example might be when we share your address with a shipping provider in order to get your purchase delivered to you, and the shipping provider also wants to use that address to improve their routes. Error: We were unable to complete your request. Please try again. This Opt-Out only applies to California Consumers, as defined by CCPA. To Opt-Out, switch the toggle to ‘out’ In Out To read more about the personal information we collect and our sharing practices, please visit our User Privacy Notice . *In order for your opt-out choice to be associated with your eBay account, you’ll need to log in to your account before making your choice. If you are not logged in, the opt-out choice will only apply to your use of eBay through the current browser you’re using and only so long as that browser’s cookies are not erased Additional site navigation About eBay Announcements Community Security Center Resolution Center Seller Center Policies Affiliates Help & Contact Site Map Copyright © 1995-2020 eBay Inc.
