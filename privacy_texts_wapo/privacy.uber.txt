Log in For California Consumers The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a privacy law that grants California residents new rights with respect to their personal information. This law is effective January 1, 2020. Our Policy On Selling Data Uber has a long-standing policy that we do not sell your data —we are not data brokers, and we don’t put your data on the open market. However, under the CCPA, some sharing of personal information necessary to provide you with personalized ads may be considered a “sale,” even if no money is exchanged.  We aren’t changing how we share your data, but we want to make sure you have choices under the new definition of "sale." When you opt out below, Uber will stop sharing your information with some of its advertising partners.  As a result, you may no longer receive personalized offers from Uber on some sites or services.
