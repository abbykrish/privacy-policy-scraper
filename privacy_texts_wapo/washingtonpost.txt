We do not detect that you are from California. If you believe this is an error, please  Contact Us . As explained further in our  Privacy Policy , the Washington Post and our advertising partners collect certain pieces of information from our visitors, such as device identifiers, cookies, advertising IDs, and IP addresses and usage activity. We and our partners may share this information with third parties to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. Below, we explain how you can control the information that is shared, and we provide important information about those choices. You will still see some advertising, regardless of these choices. Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Opt-Out The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) offers tools to provide consumers with choices as to whether participating third parties can use your information to provide targeted advertising. To opt out of sharing your information with such participating third parties for targeted advertising, please use the following tools: For websites: the DAA WebChoices Tool, available at  http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN . For mobile applications: the DAA AppChoices Tool, available at  http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices . Google Opt-Out If you are on the web, you can also opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google’s opt-out browser add-on, and opt out of interest-based Google ads using Google’s Ads Settings. Google may also participate in the DAA WebChoices Tool (above). Mobile Ad Settings If you no longer wish to receive interest-based advertising on your mobile applications, please refer to your device’s operating system settings, which may include “Limit Ad-Tracking” on iOS devices and "opt-out of interest-based advertising" on Android devices. Facebook Ad Preferences Facebook offers settings that may control what information Facebook uses about you or your device activity for advertising purposes. Login to Facebook and go to Settings > Ads > Ad Settings (web) or Ad Preferences > Ad Settings (app) for more information. LiveIntent We use LiveIntent to deliver personalized ads in some of our email newsletters. To learn more about LiveIntent or how to manage the data that LiveIntent may use to display email ads to you, please visit LiveIntent  here and review the information LiveIntent provides about your choices. You can also visit  LiveIntent's Ad Choices  page. Please note: The opt-outs described above are device and browser based. Because the information being shared relates to your device ID and/or browser ID, you must opt out on each device and each browser where you want your choice to apply. Opt-outs may be stored via cookies. If you clear cookies, your opt-out will no longer be valid and you must opt out again where you want your choices to apply. The Washington Post does not maintain or control the opt-out mechanisms and settings above and is not responsible for their operation. Exercising these choices does not prevent us from delivering contextual advertising, conducting cross-device tracking for us to serve you first-party ads directly, or using information for non-targeted advertising purposes, such as attribution and analytics. We may also still share some personal information with our partners (who will function as our service providers in such instances) to help us perform functions such as measuring ad effectiveness, controlling how many times you see an ad, determining ad performance, providing and securing ads, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, and/or reducing ad fraud. The above choices will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted by entities that do not recognize the choices exercised through the tools above). If you have any other questions or requests, please  contact us .
