The types of Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Site and/or Services and your relationship with us.   Usage Data and Site Activity   We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Site (“Usage Data”). For example, each time you use the Sites, we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, your operating system and version, your IP address, the pages you view, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, and the number of clicks to, from, and within the Site, and the duration of your visits to the Site. If the data we automatically collect is capable of being associated with you, directly or indirectly, we treat it as Personal Information. If this information is not capable of being individually associated with you, we treat it as Usage Data.   Communication Recordings   We may record calls and retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications between you and us. By communicating with us, you consent to our recording and retention of communications.  BACK TO TOP     III. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION    Voluntary Disclosure   We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us online or offline including events, surveys, and marketing or promotional programs. You are not required to provide us your Personal Information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site or Services or we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction.   Third-Party Data Sources   We may collect Personal Information from third-party data sources such as marketing agencies and partners, data brokers, analytics firms and government agencies.   Dealerships   We may collect Personal Information from dealerships with whom you interact. For example, if you purchase or service a vehicle at a dealership, the dealership may share your Personal Information with us.  BACK TO TOP     IV. COOKIES, ONLINE TRACKING, AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING    Cookie Policy   We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and other automated tools such as tracking pixels to improve the experience of our Sites and Services, such as saving your preferences from visit to visit to present you with a customized version of the Website. Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  Instructions for how to manage cookies in popular browsers are available at:  Internet Explorer ,  Firefox ,  Chrome ,  Safari (iOS) ,  Safari (Mac) , and  Opera . However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies.  We use the following types of cookies:   ·   Session Cookies : Session cookies keep track of you or your information as you move from page to page within the Site and are typically deleted once you close your browser. For example, session cookies help us deliver a relevant and personalized experience when you review our products and their features online.   ·   Persistent Cookies : Persistent cookies reside on your system and allow us to customize your experience if you leave and later return to the Site. For example, persistent cookies may allow us to remember your preferences.   ·   Advertising Cookies : Advertising cookies are used to learn more about you and advertise products/services that might interest you.   ·   Analytics Cookies :  Analytics cookies help us understand how our Site is working and who is visiting our Site. Google Analytics is one tool we use, and you can learn more by reviewing Google’s  Privacy Policy .  We employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a user’s visit to the Site. This technology helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective, how consumers engage with the Site, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Site. The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) “tracking pixels” and (2) “clear gifs.” Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a user has viewed a particular web page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a user’s session and Personal Information, if provided by the user.  If you arrive at the Site by “clicking through” from another website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the Privacy Policy of any website from which you reached the Site to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.   Interest-Based Advertising   We may work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks (“Advertisers”) to learn more about you and show you ads or other content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services as well as other websites and services. These companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Advertiser may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site or on third-party websites. If you do not want to receive interest-based advertising, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page . The DAA website allows you to opt-out of one or more interest-based advertising networks. Opt-outs are device and browser specific; therefore, you will need to set your opt-out preferences for each device and browser. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences; however, the DAA offers browser extensions  that help preserve the opt-out preferences you set on the DAA's Consumer Choice Page. Please note that opt-outs only apply to interest-based advertising. You may still receive other types of online advertising.   Information from Advertisements   If you arrive at the Sites via an advertisement (e.g., banner ad), we may collect information regarding the advertisement with which you interacted and your interactions (e.g., item clicked, date, and time).   Social Media Widgets   The Sites may include social media features, such as the Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and the pages you visit on our site as well as other Personal Information. A cookie may be set to ensure that a feature properly functions. Your interactions with features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.  BACK TO TOP     V. THIRD PARTIES THAT COLLECT INFORMATION ON OUR SITES   Certain third parties may collect Personal Information and/or Usage Data from users of our Sites using automatic information collection tools such as cookies and tracking pixels. The collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information and/or Usage Data by these third parties is governed by their privacy policies.    BACK TO TOP     VI.

Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information that we provide to them other than as specified by us.   Third-Party Sharing   We may share your Personal Information with Honda affiliates such as American Honda Finance Corporation.  Although we do not directly monetize your Personal Information, this sharing may qualify as a sale under certain privacy laws.  We may share or sell your Personal Information with other companies who do not provide services to us (“Third Parties”), including Honda and Acura dealerships and companies that provide services integrated within our products, such as satellite radio providers and connected vehicle data services platforms. These companies may use your Personal Information for their everyday business purposes, including marketing, customer service, fulfillment and related purposes.   Co-Branded Websites   We sometimes partner with companies whose products or offerings may be of interest to you.  We strive to be transparent by co-branding our Sites and clearly posting a message if you leave our Sites and navigate to another. When you visit or use a part of any Site that is co-branded or that is a part of a joint promotion involving American Honda and one or more third parties (each a “Co-Branded Party”), you are providing and consenting to provide your Personal Information and any other information collected by any Co-Branded Party to American Honda and each of the Co-Branded Parties without any other notice or further consent. We do not control Co-Branded Parties’ use or treatment of information you provide to them and you should consult each of their privacy policies or any separate Co-Branded privacy policy posted on or linked from the Co-Branded site to determine your rights with respect to their use and treatment of your information.   Other Transfers   We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with us. If we are merged, acquired or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction.  BACK TO TOP     VII. SECURITY AND OTHER INFORMATION    Security   We recognize the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of Personal Information from loss, misuse, or alteration. Accordingly, we employ commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, and use. Even with these safeguards, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our Sites or Services, you do so at your own risk.   Links   The Sites may contain links to third party websites including social media platforms. Please be aware that if you access these links, you will be leaving our site. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of those sites, as we are not responsible for their content, links, or privacy procedures.   Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement   We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to: respond to legal requests (including court orders, investigative demands, and subpoenas); to protect the safety, property, or rights of ourselves, consumers, or any other third party; to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity; or to comply with law.
