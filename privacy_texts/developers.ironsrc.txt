About Us   ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“ironSource Mobile”) operates 3 main services:       Ad Network – We have a network that connects app developers with advertisers, and helps app developers to serve ads on their apps. App developers means the company or individual that developed and operates the mobile app that is integrated with or otherwise sends information to ironSource Mobile. Advertiser is a company or an individual that advertises its products or services within the app.            Mediation Platform – A platform that helps app developers to manage all the ad providers with which they have a direct relationship (e.g. ironSource Mobile ad network, third party ad networks, additional online advertising companies, etc.) that serve ads on their apps.            Marketing Platform – We help advertisers to create and optimize advertising campaigns.       We collect information in either of 2 ways:       Directly – from your device through our SDK integrated by app developers in their apps. SDK, or a Software Development Kit, is a software component that allows us to serve ads in a mobile app, and to collect information directly from the end users of such app.            Indirectly – through other ad networks with which we engage in order to serve you with ads, or by receiving information from our advertisers.       We collect information as described in this privacy policy for ironSource Mobile’s own purposes, as a data controller under data protection law where relevant, except as otherwise indicated herein.   Scope   This privacy policy describes ironSource Mobile’s privacy practices with respect to information it processes through its ad network, mediation platform, and marketing platform. This privacy policy does not govern the use of our website, dashboard for publishers, and dashboard for advertisers.  ironSource Mobile serves ads to users all around the world. Accordingly, throughout the document, we try to harmonize our approach and the language of the privacy policy as much as possible. However, sometimes we refer to specific laws that require further disclosures. For example,  whenever you see throughout the policy the annotation “The GDPR angle”, it means that the purpose of such section is to satisfy the transparency requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and therefore it applies only to personal data (as defined by the GDPR) associated with devices who we deem to be located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. In addition, if you are a resident of Nevada, please see “The Nevada Angle” for information related to Nevada privacy rights”. If you are a resident of California, please see “The CCPA Angle” for information related to the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”).  “The CCPA Angle” sections apply only to “personal information” that is subject to the CCPA. For purposes of the CCPA, this Privacy Policy serves as both the Privacy Policy and Notice at Collection of Personal Information.   Information We Collect        Information collected directly from you through our SDK, and information provided to us by a third party ad network (“Ad Network Information”) –       Identifiers: Your Advertising ID, an additional unique identifier of available solely from within the app of the app developer which cannot be used to identify you on other apps, IP address, information about your browser settings. The term Advertising ID refers to the Google Advertising ID on Android devices, and ID For Advertising (“IDFA”) or ID For Vendor (“IDFV”) on iOS devices. The Advertising ID is a resettable persistent identifier generated by Android or iOS that allows online advertising companies to recognize your device across non-affiliated apps, for purposes such as frequency capping, attribution, fraud detection, personalized advertising, and whitelisting. You can find additional information about how to limit our use of your Advertising ID under “How to Control Your Information”.  General technical information about your device: The ironSource Mobile SDK version, your time zone, the amount of free memory on your device, the name and version of the app to which the ad is served, battery status (on Android devices only), limit ad tracking status, operating system name and version, timestamp, the name of the manufacturer of the device, the language of the operating system, the name of the mobile carrier, internet connection type (e.g. WiFi).  Interaction with our ads: An indication if you viewed or clicked on an ad.       Information received (through our SDK) from app developers that are integrated with our mediation platform (“Mediation Information”) – your age, gender, in-app purchases, advance in the game, and such other information provided by the app developer.            Information received from advertisers (through the advertiser itself or through a third party in behalf of such advertiser) (“Advertiser Information”) –       Identifiers: Your advertising ID, IP address, a unique identifier of your device available solely with respect to the advertiser, information about your browser settings.  Campaign information: an indication that you installed the advertiser’s app following a click on or a view of an ad served by us or otherwise; information about actions you performed within an advertiser’s app following such an install, such as in-app purchases, level in the game, and the number of times you opened the app; and other information that the advertiser decides to share with us.   How We Use the Information We Collect:   As stated above, we perform 3 main services. For each such service, we use the information we collect in different ways. Below is a general description of how we use your information across our services:       Serving Ads on App Developers’ Apps – We use the Ad Network Information collected from your device to serve ads on app developers’ apps. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:              Ad delivery: we use your Ad Network Information to technically enable the delivering of ads to your device.                Reporting, billing and attribution: We use your Ad Network Information to generate reports for our publishers and bill advertisers and publishers, including for ensuring that if you interacted with our ads, we will receive payment for our service.                Internal Operations: We use your Ad Network Information for internal operations, such as debugging, support, security, and improving our services.                Fraud detection and prevention: We use your Ad Network Information for detecting and preventing fraud, and for ensuring viewability of our ads.                Optimization and frequency capping: We use your Ad Network Information for optimizing advertising campaigns, including for limiting the number of times you view a specific campaign across our network, or the number of ads you view in a specific app.                Personalized advertising: Our corporate affiliates and advertisers may use your Ad Network Information for personalized advertising (i.e. ads that are based on your interest or profile).              Operating our Mediation Platform – We use your Advertising ID, IP address, and Mediation Information collected from your device to operate our mediation platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:              Reporting: We generate reports for the app developers using our mediation platform in order to allow them to better understand their audience in terms of interaction with ads.                Segmentation: We allow app developers to create segments based on parameters they configure in our mediation platform. Such segmentation allows them to use different ad networks and different ad units for different segments of users. However, this feature does not allow them to serve you with personalized advertising, as app developers cannot control the content of the ads served by different networks.                Sending ad requests on behalf of the app developer: In addition to the other information used to operate the mediation platform, we use the Ad Network Information in order to send ad requests on behalf of the app developer to ad networks with which the app developer has direct contractual relationship, but due to technical reasons, we are in the best position to populate the ad request with the Ad Network Information.              Operating our Marketing Platform – We use the Advertiser Information received from our advertisers to operate our marketing platform. More specifically, we use such information for the following purposes:              Optimizing advertising campaigns: We optimize campaigns for our advertisers based, for example, on events that happen in their app or indications of installs received from other apps.                Suppression: We use device IDs of users of an advertiser’s app in order not to serve advertising campaigns of such advertiser to such users, as they already have the advertiser’s app.                Whitelisting/blacklisting: We allow advertisers to upload lists of device IDs to include/exclude in their advertising campaigns.              Compliance with legal obligations – We may use your Ad Network Information, Mediation Information, and Advertiser Information to comply with applicable legal obligations.       The GDPR Angle:       We act as a processor – When we process Ad Network Information, Mediation Information and Advertiser Information on behalf of app developers, we act as their processors. For any request to exercise your individual rights related to such processing (including the rights of access, rectification, erasure, portability, and the right to restriction and/or object to processing), you should contact the relevant app developer.            We also act as controllers and process personal data on the basis of legitimate interest – When we process Ad Network Information for the purposes of optimization and frequency capping (to ensure you are not seeing the same ad too many times), fraud detection and prevention (to ensure that our ads are not viewed by bots, and/or any other fraudulent means), and internal operations, as detailed above (to ensure you receive smooth and secured experience), we process such personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest or the legitimate interests of our app developers.            Personalized Advertising in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland –  At the moment, we do not serve personalized ads (also known as “interest based advertising”) to users who are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland. However, as a result of technical considerations, on certain occasions, we may be included in consent pop-ups operated by app developers and ad networks that are engaged with us. If we start serving personalized advertising to users who are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we will ask you for your consent (typically through consent pop-ups managed by app developers and ad networks with which we work).            Further processing of Advertiser Information and Ad Network Information – When we process Advertiser Information, we may further process Advertiser Information and Ad Network Information for optimization of our network based on our legitimate interest.            Legal necessity – We may process your Ad Network Information, your Mediation Information, and your Advertiser Information for compliance with applicable legal obligations.       The CCPA Angle:       We act as “service providers” – In many cases, we act as a service provider to collect personal information from, or on behalf of, customers who use our services. These customers have their own privacy policies that describe how they use information. To the extent that we are processing personal information subject to the CCPA on behalf of a customer in our role as a service provider, you should reach out to that customer directly to exercise your rights under the CCPA.            The remainder of this section provides disclosures for users for cases where we are not acting as a service provider to a customer.            Personal Information We Collect, Disclose for a Business Purpose, and Sell – We collect the categories of personal information about California users identified in the chart below.  As further set forth in the chart below, in the past 12 months, we have disclosed and sold personal information about California users to third parties for business or commercial purposes.
