Introduction  1.1 Questions.  If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, feel free to email us at cpm@24hourfit.com ,  or contact us by mail at the following address:   24 Hour Fitness  P.O. Box 2689  Carlsbad, CA 92018   1.2 Scope. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect from you offline (e.g., when you sign up at one of our facilities or clubs) and does not apply to information we collect through electronic or digital means, including through our website. View our Website Privacy Policy for our information collection and privacy practices for information collected through our website, mobile website, mobile applications, and other electronic and digital means of communication.  2. Information We Collect  2.1 Information You Provide Us. We collect information from you when you purchase a membership and other services from us. The information we collect includes personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, telephone number and email address. You may also provide non-personally identifiable information, for example, demographic information such as gender and date of birth, or the name of your employer or school.  The personally identifiable information we collect may include the following:   Name  Home address  Home / mobile telephone number  Email address  Gender  Credit, debit or other payment account number and related information  Health-related information (as explained below)  Date of birth  For corporate sponsored program participants only: Name of Employer and employment verification  For health insurance related program participants only: Insurance Information  For school-related programs: name of School or Group  For children enrolled in Kid’s Club: we collect from the parent/legal guardian, the name, date of birth, parent/legal guardian contact information, list of known allergies, and physical description (hair and eye color)   Guests are asked to provide certain contact and demographic information.  We also collect a limited amount of fitness, physical activity and health related information from you if you sign-up for personal training services or our Fitness Consultation/Appointment service. This information (such as whether you suffer from a heart condition, dizziness, high blood pressure, and knee or back problems) helps you determine your eligibility to participate in our personal training and Fitness Consultation/Appointment programs. If you participate in our training or consultation/orientation programs, we may also obtain certain measurements, height, weight and age from you.  2.2 Biometric/Cardless Check-in System. 24 Hour Fitness has implemented a Biometric/Cardless Check-In system in its locations. This allows members to check-in without a membership card by using a fingerprint scanner. This is an optional program, but we think it makes check-in a lot easier.  Here is how it works - when you scan your finger (or thumb), we chart the distance between a few distinct points that are unique to you.  We then come up with an identifying number based on those distances, and that number is assigned to you in our membership system(s). Then, when you come to one of our locations, instead of presenting a membership card, you scan your finger (or thumb) at the entrance and enter your self-selected 10-digit check-in code.  That’s it.   We do not store your fingerprints, nor can the data we store be re-created into a fingerprint image.  We do not sell, lease, rent, trade or otherwise transfer the data collected by the Biometric/Cardless Check-In system to any third parties.  We only use this information to verify your identity and check you in to our facilities.   For members outside Illinois, your identifying number and 10-digit check-in code are automatically deleted from our system when your membership is terminated in our systems, or may be deleted at any time by written request
For members in Illinois, we retain your identifying number and 10-digit check-in code until the earlier of (1) the time when the initial purpose for which we collected that information has been satisfied or (2) three years following your last interaction with us.  In addition, you may request we delete this information at any time by written request.  But please note that if you make a deletion request, you will no longer be able to use our Biometric/Cardless Check-In system – you will need to bring a government issued ID to check-in.  2.3 Other Sources. We may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, commercially available sources, social networks, and other third parties, including via referrals from other members or guests or in connection with purchases of any “Add-On” memberships that include you as a member.  2.4 Aggregated Information. We may aggregate personally identifiable information.  Aggregated information is not personally identifiable information because it does not identify and is not associated with you or any other user.  2.5 In-Club Wireless Access. As a convenience to our members, internet access may be available in our facilities via wireless hotspots.  Any such in-club wireless access is provided by third parties and not by 24 Hour Fitness, and we do not collect any information in relation to your use of the in-club wireless access.  We are not responsible for such third party's privacy, information or other practices.  3. How We Use Your Information  3.1 To Provide Products, Services and Information. For example, we may use your personally identifiable information to:   Set-up your membership  Provide services and products to you  Process payments for your membership and services, including credit card, debit card and bank account debit (ACH) transactions  Contact you regarding your membership and services, and other administrative information  Track member and guest use of our facilities  Respond to your inquiries and comments  Provide advertisements, newsletters, or other marketing or promotional and other information relating to materials to you regarding products and services that we provide or otherwise offer for sale   3.2 Marketing Emails. We may use your information to send you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you. You can always opt-out of receiving marketing emails by using the opt-out feature provided with the email communications.  3.3 Our Business Purposes. We may use your information for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products and services, enhancing, improving or modifying our services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.  3.4 Other Purposes. We may use non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (such as associating your name with your employer if you are a participant in a corporate sponsored program), in which case we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information as long as it is combined.  4. How We Share Your Information  4.1 Our Third Party Service Providers. We may share your information with our third party service providers and agents who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, text messaging, credit card or other payment account processing, auditing and similar services.  Contracts with our service providers require them to keep information confidential.  4.2 Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on 24 Hour Fitness. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to or protect the rights or property of, 24 Hour Fitness, our members or others individuals. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.  4.3 Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.

If you opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you administrative messages so that you continue to receive important information (for example, transactional messages relating to your membership, purchases and club information).  6. Security of Your Information  We use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures designed to protect your personally identifiable information. Contracts with our third party service providers require them to keep information confidential. However, no storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
