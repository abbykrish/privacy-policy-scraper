SUBMIT A NEW REQUEST  VIEW, DOWNLOAD, OR DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION         Pursuant to the Activision Privacy Policy, available here , and in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations, users of our properties have certain rights.  Please note: To the extent your country or state of residence requires a response within a particular time period, you can expect a response within that time period unless we notify you otherwise. Please note, regarding requests to delete personal information:  Once Activision receives a request to delete personal information , subsequent requests to view personal information or requests to download personal information for the same account(s) cannot be performed for personal information tied to the account from before the request to delete personal information was submitted.  If a request to delete personal information is received while a request to view personal information or download personal information is being processed, it may not be possible to complete the request to view personal information or download personal information . Any reports that may have been generated for requests to view personal information or download personal information will no longer be accessible once a request to delete personal information has been processed.  If a request to view personal information or a request to download personal information has been completed and a request to delete personal information is then desired, a new request will need to be submitted. If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, or if such request is not supported by, or an exception applies under, applicable data protection laws and regulations, Activision reserves the right to refuse to act on the request, at its own discretion. If you are looking to make a personal information request for a property (e.g., game, website, service) that does not link to the Activision Privacy Policy, please reach out to the entity whose privacy policy is posted on the property to make a request under applicable data protection laws.
