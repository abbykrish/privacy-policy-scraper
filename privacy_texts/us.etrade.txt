California Consumer Privacy Act                                  person Log on                      California residents:  Your Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)                     The CCPA gives California residents the right to make the following requests about their personal information:   Request to Know: You have the right to request a copy of the categories or specific pieces of personal information that E*TRADE collects, uses, shares or sells about you.  Request to Delete: You have the right to request that E*TRADE deletes the personal information we have collected from you.  You have the right to request to be opted out from the sale of your personal information. Because E*TRADE does not and will not sell your personal information, you do not need to exercise this right.        These rights are subject to important restrictions:  E*TRADE Customers: The CCPA does not cover most of the personal information E*TRADE collects from or about you. As a result, while you may still make a CCPA request, the personal information we provide or delete in response to your request may be limited. You can always log into your account to access and update your personal information in your Account Preferences.
