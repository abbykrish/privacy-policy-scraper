For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children’s online privacy, please click here . Our Services include online services that may be used to facilitate health care for a child. A parent or guardian can create a One Medical account on behalf of a dependent child and attest that they have legal authority to do so. Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to register directly for an account. If your child directly uses their One Medical account, either with or without your permission, we may collect information directly from the child. If you prefer for your child to not directly interact with One Medical online, please do not provide account credentials to your child. Please note certain state patient privacy laws may permit a child to directly obtain certain types of health care services independent of their parent or guardian. Registration: Children cannot directly register for our Services. During the user registration process, the parent or guardian can create a children’s account by providing certain information about the child, including name, birth date, address, email and password. Consent: During account registration for a child, parents or guardians are asked to review and consent to our COPPA Parental Consent form. If a parent or guardian chooses not to consent to the collection and use of their child’s information, they may not create an online account for the child. At any time, a parent and guardian may revoke their consent for us to further collect personal information from their child online by contacting privacy@onemedical.com. Once consent is revoked, a child may not use any Services online. Section 2 of this Policy contains details about the information we collect, which extend to information we collect about children. The information we collect will be used for the purposes described in Section 3 of this Policy. Instant Message Chat. We will not knowingly communicate with a child through the instant message chat functionality on our website. If a child contacts our Services via the instant message functionality and discloses their age, we will discontinue the communication immediately. We may disclose the information in accordance with Section 4. No personal information about a child will be made available to the public or sold. We may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform business, professional, or technology services for us, always in accordance with all applicable laws including HIPAA. In addition to your right to revoke your consent for the collection of your child’s personal information, you may request to review the personal information we have collected from your child as well as request for us to delete personal information we have collected from your child. Please submit your request or any questions to privacy@onemedical.com.     Links to Third Party Sites     We may contain links to other sites that are owned or operated by third parties.
