EWS’s employment verification products use employer-provided information to offer income and employment verification services, which automates the process of employers responding to employment and income verification requests from third parties such as lenders and banks. The collection, use, and sharing of personal data for this purpose is regulated by the FCRA.

Employers and employees provide employee personal data to Equifax through these EWS products.  As part of providing EWS services, Equifax and its affiliates agree to only use personal data collected through EWS products for the purpose of providing the EWS services, and not for other purposes such as marketing. This applies to employee personal data provided to Equifax by an employer and personal data provided to Equifax by an employee through interacting with an EWS product.  In some instances, when permitted by its clients, EWS uses deidentified employee data to perform analytics, modeling and/or demographic studies. This deidentified employee data does not include any information that individually, or collectively, could be used to identify either the employer or individual employees.

Ad Networks may connect information about pages visited on our site with information about pages visited on other sites. They show advertising based on this combined information, including advertising for our products.  While we do not control Ad Networks or what they do with the information they collect, we only work with companies that have agreed to participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and abide by NAI principles, which prohibit members from connecting identifying information to information they collect through cookies without explicit consent.    Analytics Services  Our websites, products, and online advertisements often contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers, which help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations. These analytics providers are able to set or read their own cookies on your device through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites, and other products.
