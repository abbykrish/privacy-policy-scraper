This Privacy Policy applies when you access or use our websites or mobile applications that link to this Privacy Policy, become a Costco member, shop at our warehouses, contact our customer service teams, or otherwise interact with us (collectively, the “Services” ). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Services or other websites that display or reference a different Privacy Policy. Personal information you provide or we collect from Costco’s warehouses, websites or services outside of the US and Puerto Rico is governed by the privacy policies of the Costco entities in those other countries.  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy. In some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as a statement on our website).

Cookies and Similar Technologies  We use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to operate our websites and online services and to help collect data.  Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.  We use cookies on our websites to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes.  Our web pages may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear gifs) that we use to count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them.  Our websites may include web beacons and cookies from our service providers, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from other companies, such as videos, news content, or ads delivered by other ad networks (see Advertising, Services Provided by Others; Interest-Based Advertising below). Because your browser connects to web servers operated by other companies to retrieve that content, those other companies are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.  The analytics providers we use include the following:       Company/ Service  Purpose(s)  Privacy Notices  Manage Settings (opt-out)        Adobe  Advertising, analytics  https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html  https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html    Google Analytics (Costco Travel only)  Analytics  https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout      To opt-out from these companies’ collection or use of certain types of data, and to learn more about their privacy practices, click on the links above.

Choices you make regarding cookies are specific to your browser and device.

Other Sites; Social Media and Social Sharing Features  The Services may link to or integrate with content or sites operated by other companies. These companies may offer you goods and services or provide services to Costco, such as product information, product or service reviews, or marketing or analytics services.

When you use these features, you are sharing information with your friends or the public, depending on your social media account privacy settings. For information about data collection and use in connection with social sharing features, please read the privacy policies of the companies that provide these features. Any information you post or disclose on message boards, chat, profile pages, blogs and other services, including our Social Media Pages, may be public and viewable by other users.

While we strive to offer you choices when you use our Services (as described below), because of a lack of standardization regarding Do Not Track signals we are not able to receive or honor “Do Not Track” signals from your web browser at this time. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control information collection and use, including the cookie, analytics, and advertising controls described above.   7.

Deletion You can request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you to the extent required under CCPA and subject to certain exceptions. We retain personal information to service your membership, to comply with applicable laws and regulations and other permissible purposes.  That means we may not be able to delete all of your personal information. You may submit a deletion request here .  Right to Opt-Out You have the right to request to opt-out from future “sales” of your personal information. To do so, please visit our “ Do Not Sell My Information ” page. The law defines “sale” very broadly to include simply making data available to third parties in some cases.  We let advertising and analytics companies collect IP addresses, and cookie IDs through our sites and apps when you use our Services. We also disclose personal information to the companies that provide products and services to our members for their own marketing purposes as described above (see “ Sharing of Information ” section above).

After you submit your Do Not Sell request, we may continue to share some personal information with our suppliers (acting as our service providers) that do not constitute “sales” to help us perform advertising-related functions such as, but not limited to, measuring the effectiveness of our ads, managing how many times you may see an ad, reporting on the performance of our ads, ensuring services are working correctly and securely, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, improving when and where you may see ads, and/or reducing ad fraud. Any opt out choices you make will only apply to the specific email address that you provide when making the request.  You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized that person to act on your behalf, and we will need you to verify your identity directly with us. Further, to provide or delete specific pieces of personal information we will need to verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. You must use the Third Party Authorization form available on our website to authorize third parties to make an access or deletion request on your behalf .  Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising rights set out in the CCPA. For assistance making a California access or deletion request, please call  1-800-605-3364  We may deny certain requests, or fulfill a request only in part, based on our legal rights and obligations. For example, we may retain personal information as permitted by law, such as for tax or other record keeping purposes, to maintain an active account, and to process transactions and facilitate customer requests.
