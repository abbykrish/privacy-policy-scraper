Our customer contact center personnel will take your request and keep you up to date on the progress of your request. California Privacy Rights California defines personal information as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. If you live in California, you have some additional rights with respect to certain Personal Information we collect about you. This includes: Learn about the categories of personal information we have collected from or about you in the past 12 months Get a copy of personal information that we have collected from or about you no more than twice every 12 months Learn about the kinds of third party service providers we hire to help with internal business functions Obtain the categories of personal information that we may have sold or otherwise shared in the past 12 months Learn about the categories of third parties we may have sold your personal information to Request that your Personal Information be removed from our systems Opt out from our sales of personal information Lodge complaints about the way we handle your personal information Not be discriminated against for exercising your rights under this Privacy Policy You can make requests to receive copies of Personal Information and to have Personal Information deleted on behalf of members of your household by submitting requests on their behalf along with written authorization from each member of your household. You can also submit requests through an agent (like a membership organization you belong to, your attorney, or someone else you trust) that you have authorized in writing to act on your behalf. To do so you’ll need to either execute a power of attorney with them to act on your behalf or give your agent your written authorization to do so. Either way, we will need to verify your identity if you want copies of your personal information, to know about what categories of personal information we collect and sell, or have your personal information deleted. We will ask you to provide several data points to match against the information we have in our systems so that we can be sure that we are revealing potentially sensitive information about the things that you buy in our stores only to people who are entitled to receive it. If you’re making requests on behalf of your household, we will also need to verify the identities of each member of your household. In order to exercise these rights, contact us through one of the methods described in “Contacting Our Privacy Program” below.  Requests are generally free of charge, and we will generally process your request within 45 days unless we have a specific reason for an extension of time.  If for any reason we cannot fulfill your request in whole or in part, we will also let you know. Financial Incentives As part of our Loyalty program, we do provide discounts and financial incentives to individuals who enroll. When you sign up for our loyalty program, you can give us your loyalty ID at the cash register or online to get discounts on products you purchase and services we think you would be interested in based on your purchase history. You can also earn fuel points that give you discounts at participating gas stations. We select and personalize coupons, promotions, and other discounts or offers, based on what you buy and the stores and e-commerce portals you may use. Signing up for the program indicates your consent to the use or sale of information we need to identify the most relevant coupons, promotions, and other discounts or offers we present to you. The information we have collected about our loyalty program members enables us to deliver personalized offers and value to our customers, which helps us establish a relationship with our customers and is valued by Kroger as part of our focus on the customer experience. In determining the value of this data to Kroger, we consider the profit generated from the solutions or products that include personal information (as defined by CCPA), which is reasonably correlated to the value provided to the consumer through personalized coupons, promotions, and other discounts or offers. Our core data analytics solutions and models for internal and commercial applications primarily use anonymized customer data. These programs are valuable to us to understand what matters to you, our customer. These allow us to deliver relevant value to our customers. As part of our Loyalty program, our best customers currently save $699 per year on average. Participation in these programs is voluntary. After joining our loyalty program, if you wish to opt out of the loyalty program or wish to opt out of the sale of your personal information to support the program, you can contact our privacy office for assistance. While we will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under CCPA, if you request deletion of your data, we will not be able to send you personalized coupons, promotions, and other discounts or offers or marketing communications.  For example, we may no longer be able to send or share with you, personalized coupon mailers or personalized digital offers. Sales of Personal Information Kroger is committed to delivering great products, great experiences and great value. From time to time, we leverage your data to understand the most relevant product recommendations and deliver marketing messages and personalized offers.  Under California law, some of these efforts may be considered a “sale” of personal information to those analytics and advertising partners that help us match your interests with brands who want to send promotions that we believe save you money on products you buy frequently, and help you discover new products that you might like. When we work with these companies, your privacy, data integrity and security remain a priority. Our normal practice is to have contractual limits on their future use of your personal information and only provide the minimum data necessary to accomplish the personalization task and deliver a better experience and value to you as our customer.  We also facilitate your right to opt out of this data sharing. In order to exercise the right to opt out of sale, click on our Do Not Sell link below, or contact us through one of the methods described in “Contacting Our Privacy Program” section below.
