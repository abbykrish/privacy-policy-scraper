California law defines "personal information" broadly as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household. This Notice also uses that definition for personal information.  California law provides you the right to request:   Access.

You can find more detail about our practices in our Privacy Policy, including in the " Online Advertising and Third Parties We Work With " section. Even though we do not provide personal information to these companies for money, California law may characterize our providing the following categories of information we share with companies that provide services to you or to us, such as personalizing your experience with us or helping us to market or advertise our products and services to you, as "sales" of personal information:   Device and browsing information and other Internet activity information  Purchase or other commercial information  Demographic information  Identifiers and contact information  Inferences   Please see the " What Categories of Information We Collect " section of our Privacy Policy for further information about what these categories of personal information include.
