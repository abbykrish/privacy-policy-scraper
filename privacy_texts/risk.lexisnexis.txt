LexisNexis Risk Solutions has diligently worked to implement the requirements of the law and is following a detailed compliance plan. We also have a suite of data governance capabilities and industry-leading identity authentication services that can be used for your own CCPA compliance efforts.  The CCPA creates significant new privacy rights for California consumers as well as new obligations for companies that collect or sell personal information. In order to comply with the CCPA, LexisNexis Risk Solutions has reviewed its data sets and has made plans by data and product.  We are also using our proprietary linking process to verify identities and process consumer rights under the CCPA. The CCPA includes exemptions for certain data subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA). It also exempts data from government agency records.  As a result of these exemptions, many LexisNexis Risk Solutions products are either not subject to the law or are minimally impacted. LNRS is continuing to track regulatory developments from the California Attorney General’s Office and will make adjustments as necessary.  For more information, please contact us at ccpa@lexisnexisrisk.com .  Using LexisNexis Risk Solutions LexID and Authentication Services for CCPA Compliance   LexID Service  Our customers face CCPA compliance challenges due to the fact that much of the personal data they currently hold about California residents is unstructured. For example, businesses with direct consumer relationships often have an account number for each consumer. That account number is a useful tool for organizing data about  customers.  However, these same businesses usually have additional data such as email addresses that are not associated with a given account.  The LexisNexis Risk Solutions LexID service can help a business structure its personal data and associate it with a specific consumer identity. It is created using our unparalleled US consumer data set coupled with advanced artificial intelligence-driven linking techniques.  For more information about using our LexID services for CCPA compliance, please contact us at ccpa@lexisnexisrisk.com .  Identity Verification and Authentication Services  A number of our customers use LexisNexis Risk Solutions identity verification and authentication services when they receive requests from consumers seeking to exercise their CCPA rights.  Authentication is particularly important when a consumer requests to be informed about what data a business holds about them.  A key initial step upon receiving such a request is to ensure that the individual seeking such information is in fact who they claim to be. Further details on authentication requirements will likely be included in the final regulations from the California Attorney General’s office, but it is clear that authentication is required by the statute. Therefore, now is the time to plan and integrate the authentication process with your organization’s other privacy processes.  The challenge is to ensure the individual who is submitting a CCPA request isn’t a fraudster — without sacrificing a legitimate consumer’s experience or generating high authentication costs. The multiplicity of consumer touchpoints and devices makes doing this more complex, but also more critical. Our identity verification and authentication solutions help you find balance, mitigate fraud, improve end user satisfaction and easily adapt to emerging channels and trends. We have the tools to help your organization create a comprehensive, layered approach or easily plug into your existing identity management framework. Our capabilities and offerings include:   Out of Band solutions to help support higher levels of assurance.  Advanced analytics that yield perceptive insights that allow for a more tailored approach to authentication.  One of the largest compilations of consumer and business identity intelligence including those individuals with limited or no credit histories.  Administration through a single, streamlined platform.   For more information about using our authentication services for CCPA compliance, please contact us at ccpa@lexisnexisrisk.com .
