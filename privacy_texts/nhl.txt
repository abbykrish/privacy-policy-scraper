The linked services should have separate and independent privacy statements, notices, and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully.

If you would like to use an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your California privacy rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information simply because you have exercised your California privacy rights. We may offer financial incentives for your participation in contests, sweepstakes, fantasy or interactive games, or other promotions that require the provision of certain information, such as where we provide you an incentive designed to encourage participation in such a promotion. In addition, California residents who are registered users of the Services and are under the age of 18 are entitled, in accordance with California law, to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post as user content on the Services.

Please note that your request does not ensure the complete or comprehensive removal of the material. Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites and online services should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals. 11.
