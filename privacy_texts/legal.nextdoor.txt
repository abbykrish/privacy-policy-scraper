                    About  News  Media Assets  Blog  Business  Careers                      California “Do Not Sell My Info” Notice  Effective January 1, 2020  We don’t charge you to use Nextdoor.  Instead, businesses and organizations pay us to show you ads for their products and services and, like many companies online, we sometimes use services provided by Google, Facebook, and others to help deliver interest-based ads to you.  California law may classify our limited information sharing with advertising partners and use of these services as a “sale” of personal information from which California residents have the right to opt-out.  This is because our advertising partners and the companies that provide these services collect limited information from our users (e.g., cookies, advertising IDs, Internet Protocol addresses, and usage activity) to help them understand how people interact with advertising content on and off Nextdoor and to serve ads that they think users may want to see based on their online activity.  It is important to note that we do not sell your name, email address, physical address, or phone number unless you give us specific permission.  But we wanted to take this opportunity to explain your choices regarding how to control the limited information that is shared.  More information about cookies and advertising IDs is available in our Cookie Policy and more information about the information we collect, use, and share is available in our Privacy Policy .
