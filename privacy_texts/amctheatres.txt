You may provide AMC with two types of information during your visit to AMC’s website or your use of our App.   Information AMC collects automatically  Information that you voluntarily share with AMC   The information we collect includes “personal information,” which can have different meanings depending on applicable law. In general, we use the term “personal information” to mean information that can uniquely identify you, but we will treat information we collect from you as personal information wherever necessary under applicable law.  AMC automatically collects information from you when you visit AMC’s website or use our App, such as the search engine you used to access the AMC website, the previous websites you visited, the websites or advertisements you view or select, the type of browser or device you use, the operating system you use, your computer or device's IP address or other unique identifier, and information about the way you use our App. AMC also collects information concerning your movie preferences, such as the movies for which you purchase tickets and the theatres in which you view those movies.  AMC may collect the mobile phone number you use to send AMC a text message, and the content of the message. When you send a text message to AMC, the incoming phone number, the wireless service provider and the date and time of the message will be logged by AMC.  AMC may also assign a unique identifying number, code, or both, to the computer or device that you use to visit or access an AMC website or App, and AMC may collect other information during a particular web browsing session and over time.  You can search the AMC website and the App for movie information, movie show times, and the AMC theatres closest to you. If you use such location-enabled parts of the App or the AMC website, you may be sending AMC location information. This information may reveal your precise or approximate location.  AMC may also use third-party providers to place and manage AMC’s advertisements on the AMC website and App. These third parties may use cookies and other technology to automatically collect information on AMC’s behalf about your visits to AMC websites, use of the Apps and visits to other websites in order to provide advertisements about AMC goods and services that may be of interest to you.  We may ask you to provide personal information when you create an online account, sign up for AMC Stubs™ loyalty program, download and register the App, purchase products or services, join a frequent moviegoer or other loyalty program, subscribe to AMC SMS text message communications, participate in a sweepstakes, promotion or survey, contact AMC with a question or concern, or participate in other activities when you visit an AMC website or use the App. If you are a member of social media networks or services, and you authorize AMC to associate your account or the App with that network or service, AMC will gather information about your online behavior at the AMC websites or through your use of the App, will associate that information with personal information AMC already has about you and use it on-line or offline, in accordance with this privacy policy. AMC also collects personal information that you may disclose on the AMC website or through use of the App, such as ratings or review pages, blogs, and message boards.  Back to Top  2. How Does AMC Use Information?  AMC does not sell your personal information.  AMC uses personal information for the purpose for which you provided it, such as to fulfill your request for products, services or Data, to process and administer your contest or sweepstakes entry, to activate and maintain your account on our website or App, and to allow you to participate in public areas of the AMC website. AMC also uses personal information to notify you of changes to AMC’s websites, to provide you with entertainment news, e-mail offers, SMS text message offers and movie ticket savings, to let you know about other products and services that may be of interest to you, and to tailor AMC's online or in-store offerings to your preferences.  AMC uses anonymous information collected by its third party advertisers to serve you with advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. AMC combines anonymous usage information collected from your visit to an AMC website or use of our App with that of other users to determine which features and areas of the website or App are most popular. By collecting and analyzing this information, AMC can improve the AMC websites and App. This aggregated information does not contain information personally associated with you.  AMC may also update and supplement personal information collected from you with other information that AMC obtains from third parties or from AMC's subsidiaries and affiliates. If AMC associates information obtained from affiliates and subsidiaries or other third parties with personal information collected under this policy, AMC will treat the acquired information like information AMC has collected itself.  Back to Top  3. Does AMC Share or Transfer the Information I Provide?  AMC may share your information:  With AMC Subsidiaries.  AMC may share your personal information with AMC subsidiaries to provide you with AMC entertainment news, e-mail offers, SMS text message offers and movie ticket savings, and to let you know about AMC products and services that may be of interest to you, and other business purposes.  With Service Providers.  AMC may share your personal information with third parties that provide services for AMC, such as fulfilling orders, Data and information requests, to improve your experience with the App and on AMC’s website and for other business purposes. AMC will share your personal information with these third parties for these purposes; however, these third parties will not contact you directly.  As Required by Law.  From time to time, AMC may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or other governmental agencies in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. AMC also reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that AMC, in good faith, believes to be unlawful. AMC also may share certain personal information when it believes that such sharing is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and itself.  As Part of a Business Transaction.  AMC may also disclose your personal information to third parties in relation to planned or potential corporate sales, mergers, reorganizations, consolidations, dissolutions, bankruptcies, or similar events.  Back to Top  4. How Does AMC Keep My Personal Information Secure?  We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. Please be aware that, although AMC strives to keep your personal information secure, no security measures are absolute. Use caution when transmitting personal information over the Internet.  Back to Top  5. Does AMC Use Cookies or Other Technologies?  The AMC website and App use technology (e.g., cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags) to collect and store information concerning your use of the AMC website and App, in order to recognize you, provide personalization, optimize performance of the AMC website and App, and collect traffic data (e.g., number of visitors to the AMC website, frequency of visits or use, length of visit, and the use made, or the feature, function or advertisement selected). If you choose to reject all cookies or similar technology, you may be unable to use much of the functionality of the AMC website and App.  The App may also use various technologies to track your web browsing activity conducted through the App and may store such information on your mobile device. Many mobile devices have this technology pre-loaded or incorporated in the web browser, or the technology may be included in a mobile application you download and use on your device. You may be able to manage that information gathering and storage through your device.  In some instances, these cookies may be used by us or other web sites during your future navigation of the internet to target specific advertisements to you based on your previous use of the AMC website, the App, or other websites. The AMC website may also read cookies already stored within your browser to identify non-personal information about you and communicate this information to other advertisers. You may remove cookies used by the AMC website for advertising purposes by deleting cookies from your browser history.  Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. Instead, we collect, use, and share information as described in this privacy policy regardless of a “do not track” choice.  Back to Top  6. Can Other Parties Obtain Information From Me When I Visit an AMC Website?  AMC may allow third parties to deliver advertisements on the AMC website, through the App or SMS text messages. The AMC website and App may also contain links to websites that are owned and operated by third parties. You should be aware that when you click on these third-party advertisements or links, you may deploy technology (such as cookies or web beacons), which third parties may use to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously been to their website or otherwise had contact with them. AMC has no responsibility (and disclaims any representations, warranties or responsibility) for these third-party advertisements and websites, including, without limitation, their content and privacy policies. AMC encourages you to read the privacy policies of the advertisers and websites to learn how they may collect and use information about you.  If you voluntarily disclose personal information in a public area of the AMC website or App, such as a review page, blog or message board, third parties may collect this information and use it to send you unsolicited marketing communications, messages or for other purposes. You disclose personal information in public areas of the AMC website or App at your own risk.  Back to Top  7. How Do I Contact AMC to Request Access or Correction to My Personally Identifiable Information?  AMC retains your personal information for as long as you use the App, remain a member of the AMC Stubs™ loyalty program, or maintain an online account with an AMC website, and for a reasonable time thereafter. AMC retains anonymous information it collects under this privacy policy for up to two years from the date of collection, and thereafter may only retain such information in the aggregate.  You may obtain a copy of your personal information maintained by AMC by contacting AMC Entertainment, Attention: Privacy Manager, 11500 Ash Street, Leawood, KS 66211 or at privacymanager@amctheatres.com . For your protection, you will be required to provide proof of your identity to obtain a copy of your personal information. You may correct any errors in your personal information by providing AMC with the correct information. You may uninstall the App from your mobile device at any time, and AMC will make reasonable efforts to delete the personal information in its possession concerning your use of the App; however, you will continue to receive e-mail, SMS text messages and other communications if you selected those services through your account at the AMC website. AMC will delete all of your personal information (except for your transaction history) from AMC's records upon your written request. However, you will not be able to access some areas of the AMC website, use some aspects of the App or have the App function properly if you choose to delete your personal information.
