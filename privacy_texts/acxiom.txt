POWERED BY                       Acxiom recognizes that consumers should have choices regarding the use of information about themselves. Acxiom believes in transparency, accountability, and consumer control. Therefore, we take an ethical approach to data collection and use that goes beyond what the law requires by also addressing what is just and fair to consumers. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California consumers with various rights with respect to their personal information, including a Right to Know, Right to Delete , and a Right to Opt-Out from the sale of Personal Information. In order to provide an easy, yet secure, process for consumers to make these requests, Acxiom will utilize an automated portal platform through which California consumers may submit requests available to them under CCPA. Please note that this portal includes certain verification procedures that are required under the CCPA based upon the types of personal information requested. Acxiom takes seriously the safety and security of individuals and the data that we maintain about them. Please be prepared to receive multiple email communications as part of the verification process, some of which may include a time limit on your response. Please allow yourself plenty of time to complete the verification steps and to respond to all confirmation messages issued by Acxiom. If you are a California consumer and are requesting the Right to Opt-Out from the Sale of Personal Information, click here . If you would like to submit a request for a “Right to Know” consumer access report or “Right to Delete” personal information, please note that, for the safety and security of the personal information that Acxiom maintains about California consumers, there are minimum procedures required prior to acceptance of these requests. Acxiom will require you to verify your identity and the following information will be required for this verification procedure: name, a valid email address (which will be used as a direct form of communication with you), a photograph of the front and back of your driver’s license, and a separate photograph of you (i.e., a “selfie”). If you are a California consumer and wish to proceed, the following options are available: ·      To request your Right to Know Consumer Access Report, enter the required information in the form below and leave the default Access button selected. ·      To only request your Right to Delete, enter the required information in the form below, de-select the Access button, and select the Delete button. ·      To request both your Right to Know Consumer Access Report and your Right to Delete, enter the required information in the form below, leave the default Access button selected, and also select the Delete button. A request ID will be sent to you at the email address you submitted. Keep this request ID handy, as we will use it to communicate with you throughout this process. We will also send you an additional email with instructions on how to complete your request. ·      For more information, visit Acxiom’s US Products Privacy Policy, here . ·      For additional information on CCPA instructions, click here .
