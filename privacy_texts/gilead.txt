This Privacy Statement applies to all Personal Information received and processed by Gilead. “Personal Information” means any information or set of information that relates to an individual, which can be either direct or indirect, and can be collected by or on behalf of Gilead.  Please read this Privacy Statement before using Gilead Services or submitting Personal Information to Gilead. By accessing and using the “Services”, you agree and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Statement.  Gilead and certain of its US affiliates (covered entities) participate in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework . Gilead acknowledges its commitment to comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles (“Principles”) for all Personal Information received from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland which was provided in reliance on Privacy Shield.  Gilead will collect, use and disclose Personal Information received from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland only in accordance with the principles outlined in this Privacy Statement, the above-noted Privacy Shield Principles, and legal requirements. For purposes of Privacy Shield compliance enforcement, Gilead acknowledges that it is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC).     How do we collect information?          Directly from individuals  Through our websites and mobile apps  From healthcare professionals  From contract research organizations and clinical trial investigators  From individuals enrolled in clinical trials  From government agencies or public records  From third party service providers, data brokers or business partners  From industry and patient groups and associations  From time to time, we may use or augment the Personal Information we have about you with information obtained from other sources, such as public databases, social media platforms and other third parties.

If you are a healthcare professional, we may also collect:   Professional credentials, educational and professional history, institutional and government affiliations, and information included on a resume or curriculum vitae (such as work experience, education, and languages spoken)  Information about the Gilead programs, products and activities with which you have engaged  Details about our interactions with you, your prescribing of our products and the agreements you have executed with us  Publicly-available information related to your practice, such as license information, disciplinary history, prior litigation and regulatory proceedings, and other due diligence related information.

Legal bases include:   The transfer or processing is in Gilead’s legitimate interest in providing you with access to our Services and programs  The transfer or processing is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Gilead (or one of its affiliates)  The transfer or processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, concluded in your interest, between Gilead (or one of its affiliates) and a third party  The transfer or processing is necessary, or legally required, on important public interest grounds, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or to protect your vital interests  The transfer or processing is required by applicable law           How we share Personal Information         Within our family of companies  In the normal course of performing Services for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within Gilead and its affiliates for research and statistical purposes, drug safety and efficacy purposes, disease management, system administration and crime prevention or detection, or any purpose otherwise identified in this Privacy Statement.  With our Service Providers  We may retain other companies and individuals to perform Services on our behalf and we may collaborate with other companies and individuals with respect to particular products or Services. Examples of service providers include data analysis firms, credit card processing companies, customer service and support providers, email and SMS vendors, web hosting and development companies and fulfillment companies. Providers also include our co-promote partners for products that we jointly develop and/or market with other companies. Some providers may collect Personal Information on our behalf.  In connection with Business Transactions  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets.  In such transactions, user information, including Personal Information, generally is one of the transferred business assets.  Also, if either Gilead itself or substantially all of Gilead assets were acquired, your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.  Therefore, we may disclose and/or transfer your Personal Information to a third-party in these circumstances.  To comply with our legal obligations  Gilead reserves the right to disclose without your prior permission any Personal Information about you or your use of the Services if Gilead has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Gilead, our employees, other users of the Services, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of the Services; (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent governmental authority and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process; or (d) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties.  We may also disclose Personal Information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.  We may also disclose aggregate or de-identified data that is not personally identifiable to third parties for any purpose.  Please note, Gilead does not sell Personal Information to third parties.          How does Gilead collect information online?         Gilead websites and apps may collect information that could be potentially personally identifiable about your visits without you actively submitting such information. Unidentified information may be collected using various technologies, such as cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your computer's hard disk by a website. Web beacons (also referred to as GIF files, pixels, or internet tags) help Gilead understand how you navigate around the Gilead websites. As part of your use of the site, your internet browser automatically transmits to Gilead websites some of this information, such as the URL of the website you just visited and the browser version your computer is operating. Passive information collection technologies can make your use of Gilead websites easier by allowing Gilead to provide better service, customize Gilead websites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, analyze trends, and otherwise administer and improve Gilead websites. You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser, though certain features of Gilead websites may not work without use of passive information collection technologies. Information collected by these technologies cannot be used to identify you without additional information.  Some of Gilead's business partners, with whom Gilead contracts to carry out the Services (e.g., website providers), may use their cookies on Gilead websites and apps. Although Gilead may not have direct access to or control over such cookies, this Privacy Statement governs the use of cookies by Gilead and such business partners on Gilead websites and apps. Gilead may also allow social media companies (e.g., Facebook) to put “widgets” on Gilead websites. These third-party tools may also be used to track you across websites. For example, so long as you are logged in to Facebook, every time you land on a webpage that has a Facebook widget, Facebook will know you are on that webpage. Gilead does not control the privacy practices of these third parties.  Some internet browsers allow you to limit or disable the use of tracking technologies that collect unidentified information, such as a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) setting. Currently, we do not respond to DNT signals.          Special Programs and Clinical Trials         Gilead may offer apps, special programs, clinical trials, activities, events or promotions (“Programs”) that have unique or additional specific terms, privacy notices and/or consent forms that explain how any information you provide will be processed in connection with the Programs. Certain Programs may include options to help you afford your medications.  Where required, we may provide additional terms. You should review the terms applicable to the Programs before interacting or participating in the Program.          Choice         Where Gilead relies on consent for the fair and lawful processing of Personal Information, the opportunity to consent will be provided prior to when the Personal Information in question is collected.  Your consent may be given through your authorized representative such as a legal guardian, agent, or holder of a power of attorney. Where Gilead relies on consent, you will be entitled to withdraw that consent at any time.          International Data Transfers         Gilead maintains servers and other storage facilities in the United States, EU, and Asia. Gilead may transfer Personal Information outside of its country of origin for the purposes, and in the manner, set out in this Privacy Statement, including for processing and storage by service providers and affiliates in connection with such purposes.  In all situations, Gilead takes reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.  Such steps include, but are not limited to, implementing privacy, security, and contractual controls, as well as steps noted in this Privacy Statement, as required by applicable law.  To the extent that any Personal Information is sent outside of an individual’s country, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country, consistent with the Principles.  Gilead endeavors to obtain assurances from its service providers and affiliates that they will safeguard Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Statement.  An example of appropriate assurances that may be provided by service providers and affiliates includes a contractual obligation that they provide at least the same level of protection as is required by Gilead’s privacy principles set out in this Privacy Statement.  Where Gilead has knowledge that a service provider or affiliate is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Statement, Gilead will take appropriate steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.  Gilead complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom and/or Switzerland, as applicable to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield.  Gilead has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/ .          Security         Gilead has implemented reasonable physical, technical and managerial controls and safeguards to keep your Personal Information protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  Such measures may include, but are not limited to: the encryption of communications via SSL, encryption of information while it is in storage, firewalls, access controls, separation of duties, and similar security protocols.  Gilead trains its employees on the importance of privacy and how to handle and manage Personal Information appropriately and securely.  Personal Information handled by agents, or companies with which Gilead may conduct joint programs, is governed by this Privacy Statement and the Principles.  Please note, the confidentiality of Personal Information transmitted over the Internet cannot be guaranteed. Gilead urges you to exercise caution when transmitting Personal Information over the Internet. Gilead cannot absolutely guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Information; therefore, when submitting Personal Information to Gilead online, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.          Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation         Gilead will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected, or consented to by the individual.  Gilead will have appropriate steps in place to ensure that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.  Gilead will only store Personal Information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, subject to applicable data retention periods imposed upon Gilead by applicable law. This may mean that your Personal Information is stored by Gilead for a number of years, depending on the purpose and need for that data to be processed. For more information about Gilead’s retention periods for Personal Information, please refer to the contact information section below.          Your Rights         You may have certain rights and choices regarding our processing of your Personal Information.

We reserve the right to verify your identity in connection with any requests regarding Personal Information to help ensure that we provide the information we maintain to the individuals to whom it pertains, and allow only those individuals or their authorized representatives to exercise rights with respect to that information.  If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we may require additional information to verify that you are authorized to make that request. This may include obtaining a written authorization and proof that you are authorized to make the request.  Gilead may not be able to comply with a request where Personal Information has been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with Gilead’s record retention obligations and practices.

The Notice shall contain a summary of steps taken to resolve the claim, a description of the alleged violation, and, at the choice of the individual, any supporting documents and materials and/or a discussion of law relating to the alleged claim.
