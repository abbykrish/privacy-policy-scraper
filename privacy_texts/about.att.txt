AT&T – like nearly every company that provides a service – collects certain data that enables us to deliver it. For example, your address lets us deliver billing statements and special offers. Data from online activity helps us detect fraud and secure our network and devices.  We sometimes share information within our family of businesses so they can connect you to services, offers or promotions that might be of interest to you, such as upgraded internet service or a subscription to HBO. When we share with others, it’s for limited reasons with strict privacy protections. We don’t sell data that directly identifies you unless we have your explicit permission.  AT&T’s Privacy Principles, which guide our responsible data practices, give you choices about how your information is shared. CCPA adds to those choices. Specifically, the law allows California residents to:   Request to view the information that we collect about you.  Tell us not to sell information that is linked to you.  Request deletion of information that is linked to you.   It’s important to note that if you’re happy with your online experience, then you don’t have to take any action as the result of CCPA.   California residents:   If you want us to prepare a report with the data we have about you, go here:  Access my data icon button    It may include information you’ve shared with us, data from your services and marketing info. We strive to provide your report quickly. Please know that much of your info, like service details, is already available at att.com/myatt . The full report may take up to 45 days to complete, depending in part on how many services you use.       You can also ask us to delete certain information we have about you here:  Delete my data icon button    We’ll keep data needed for security and fraud protection, compliance with legal obligations, and running the business.       You can ask us not to sell your personal information here:  Do not sell my information icon button    Unless you give us explicit permission, we don’t sell data that directly identifies you. We may sell data among the AT&T companies or to other companies. When we do, it’s for limited reasons with strict privacy controls. You can make choices about that sharing here .     Make your request more complete. First fill out your request with us. Then, submit a request with our advertising company, Xandr .   You may have some additional questions, so we’ve listed some common questions and answers below.     What changed as a result of the California Consumer Privacy Act? Arrow  The law lets California residents see the information collected about them. It lets them tell companies to delete their information, or not to sell their information. AT&T has always provided a level of transparency, choice and control to customers.     What actions do I need to take? Arrow  If you’re happy with your online experience, you don’t need to take any actions. Your access to online services and websites is not changing as a result of the new law.     If I request my information, what will I receive? Arrow  If you are a California resident and we verify your identity, we’ll send you an Access Report. It will contain items linked to you, like data about your services with us and marketing information.     Do I have to be a California resident? Arrow  We’re implementing California’s new privacy rules for California residents. You can see marketing and privacy options at our Privacy Center .

If you delete it, you may miss out on special pricing, packages, and opportunities.        × Updates to the AT&T Privacy Policy   We made some updates and clarifications to our Policy effective February 15, 2019. Here is a summary:    We've added Xandr to our list of examples of the various AT&T companies. That's the name of the advertising company we formed last year.  We've clarified that the policy's definition of Anonymous Information includes advertising IDs when they can't be used to identify you.  We note that advertising IDs are used and shared to deliver ads to you and help advertisers assess the effectiveness of their ad campaigns. You have the choice to opt in to some advertising programs, or say no to others. You can make your choices at att.com/cmpchoice .        ×  We've Updated Our Privacy Policy   We are updating our Privacy Policy. Our new policy is clearer about how we collect, use, and protect your information, and it is consistent with evolving state privacy and disclosure laws. Learn more below.  FAQ  What’s changed?  We haven’t changed our commitment to protecting your data. But individual states are now enacting laws that define “personal information” and the sale of information in new ways. So, we’ve updated some of our language, and we have made our new policy clearer about how we collect, use, and protect your information. You have the same range of choices to manage the use of your data.  Are you selling my personal information?  The Privacy Policy describes how we share your information. California may consider the following two ways that we share data to be a sale of personal information.   We provide limited data to companies that help create, deliver and measure advertisements. This can include information like your age range, gender and ZIP code, along with basic device information – but not your name or email. The data is attached to a numeric ID assigned to your device or household.  We sell limited data to help create aggregated reports such as television ratings – what people watch on TV in a city. Data is attached to a numeric ID assigned to your mobile device or set-top box – not your name or email.   Can I manage what gets shared or sold?  You can see options to manage your data here . We’ll keep your choices until you change them.  When is the new policy effective?  The section explaining your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act is effective January 1, 2020. The full policy will be effective on March 16, 2020, however you  can review the old policy that will be in effect until then.               Looking for the full Privacy Policy?    We’ve done our best to give you the high-level points in an easy-to-understand format on this site, but we understand that sometimes you want the full policy.
