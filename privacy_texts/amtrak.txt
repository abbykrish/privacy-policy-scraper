Reservation of Rights     We reserve the right to disclose personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, bring or defend against legal action involving someone who may be violating this Policy or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Amtrak's rights or property, other Amtrak users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information for administrative or other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain or improve our products, services or the operation of the Site, for law enforcement purposes, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any such other web sites, and we cannot accept responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of those other sites. Please refer to those sites' privacy policies for information about their practices.

Section 5 — What Security Precautions We Have in Place to Protect the Loss, Misuse or Alteration of Your Personal Information     When you make reservations, place orders, or access account information from the Site, we use encryption technology to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information as it travels over the Internet. We protect against unauthorized access all of the customer data we collect by means of firewalls and other security measures.  Your Amtrak Guest Rewards membership account information (should you enroll in the Amtrak Guest Rewards program) are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your Amtrak account and close your browser window or the mobile application when you have finished.  When you give Amtrak personal information about you, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of Amtrak and outside of the state where you entered that information. Whenever we handle personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Amtrak.com, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. However, we cannot accept liability for disclosure of any personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized ads or errors and omissions of third parties.
