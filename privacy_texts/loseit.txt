            main points:   We collect various types of information about users, including personal diet data entered by users into
               our products (such a height and weight, gender, and details about food and drinks), genetic data (where
               provided by a user), and information about your use of our products (like contact and device
               information). Users must specifically consent to the sharing of genetic data with us.  We use the information we collect to make our products better and improve your experience. We share data
               in three important ways:  We share data that does not personally identify you with third parties such as advertisers
                     and business partners.  We share data that does personally identify you with third parties that support our
                     communication with you via email or messages or that provide analytics that permit us to better
                     understand how our products are used.  We also share data that does personally identify you in much more limited circumstances,
                     such as when we are required by law or if our company is acquired or merges with another company.    You have choices regarding your personal information and the way that we communicate with you. All users
               can confirm,
                  change, or update personal information , as well as opt-out of

               cease processing of personal information that pertains to you. You can learn more by visiting
                  this page .  Our servers are based in the United States, and so data about users is transferred from around the world

               collect and use your personal information to perform our agreement with you.  Consent – We may use or disclose some of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy
               subject to your consent.  Legitimate interests – We may use your personal information for our legitimate interests to improve our
               products and services. Consistent with our legitimate interests and any choices that we offer or consents
               that may be required under applicable laws, we may use technical information as described in this Privacy
               Policy and use personal information for our marketing purposes.   Transfer and Processing of Data  For users within the United States, we process data in data centers located in the United States. We have
            adopted reasonable physical, technical, and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized, or
            unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use, or processing of user data in our
            possession. We comply with state and federal laws governing the protection of personal information.  For users within the European Union, we transfer data from the European Union to data centers located in the
            United States for processing. The European Commission has determined that the law of the United States does
            not provide a level of protection adequate to satisfy the requirements of Regulation 2016/679 of the
            European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to
            the processing of personal data and free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection
            Regulation (“GDPR”). As to users residing in the EU, however, we extend the rights provided for by the GDPR
            – as detailed below – including the imposition of required safeguards with respect to accidental,
            unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use or processing of data.
            Transfers of EU resident data from the EU to the United States from third parties (such as third party
            payment processors) are conducted in accordance with appropriate transfer mechanisms under the GDPR,
            principally contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.  Data Retention and Deletion  We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it
            was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or
            reporting requirements. In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no
            longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer personal information.  It is our policy to retain personal information for 6 months once such personal information is no longer
            necessary to deliver the Website and Apps and to delete such personal information thereafter. This means
            that, if you close your account with us, we will delete personal information associated with your account
            after 6 months. Regarding other types of information we collect as described in this policy, it is our
            policy to retain such personal information for 6 months and to delete such personal information thereafter.  DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE  Lose It! does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted
            advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do
            keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they
            present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may be able to set the DNT signal so that third
            parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.  Third parties that have content embedded on the Websites or App such as a social feature may set cookies on
            a user's browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited the Websites from a
            certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from the
            Websites unless you provide it to them directly.  Contact Information  We welcome your input on our privacy statement. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our
