The policies described in this VIZIO Privacy Policy do not apply to these parties, which may have their own privacy policies.  Information Posted on VIZIO.com.  W here applicable, if you post user comments or engage in similar activity, please remember that anything you post may be publicly available.  In other words, publicly displayed information is public.  Portions of your user profile may also be available to other users of or visitors to VIZIO’s sites.  Any such submissions to VIZIO will be public and will not be considered information. VIZIO does not control, and is not responsible for, the actions of other users of the VIZIO site with respect to any information you post.  In addition, information that you post may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes.  Sharing Viewing Data with Data Partners. VIZIO associates Viewing Data with other data about the performance, settings, or features of a particular VIZIO device.  Our authorized cloud service providers may store this data solely on our behalf and for no other purposes.  We may share Viewing Data with vendors, consultants and service providers who work on our behalf and make our business-to-business activities in digital advertising possible. We also license Viewing Data to analytics companies, media companies, advertisers, ad agencies, and other ad technology companies who measure ad effectiveness or aid personalization of ads, through written agreements which strictly prohibit attempts at identification or re-identification of shared information. Viewing Data is used for the purposes listed below:   Summary Analytics and Reports. VIZIO’s select data partners analyze Viewing Data to create summary reports to help deliver relevant information and advertising to interested groups of consumers.  These summary reports are built from automated analysis of data elements, without connecting the information to any known natural person.  For example, a data partner who is an advertiser may want to measure the effectiveness of their promotions, in the aggregate.  Thus, the  data partner may identify another device that shares an IP address with the VIZIO TV or display and analyze: (a) whether a particular website was viewed or commercial location was visited by a device with location tracking enabled (e.g., a smartphone) after a related promotion was viewed, and (b) whether a particular program was viewed following exposure to a promotion for that program.  In addition, some data partners are authorized to use a third-party data aggregator to identify demographic traits (such as gender or age range or income range) associated with the IP addresses that VIZIO collects, and then send to the data partners the demographic information associated with those IP addresses.  Audience Measurement. VIZIO and select data partners may use Viewing Data to understand what customers watch in order to deliver more relevant content and advertising, for example, by determining which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, and whether and how often people watch commercials.  VIZIO and select data partners may also combine Viewing Data with other demographic and similar information, including by working with data aggregators.  Tailored Advertisements. VIZIO also licenses Viewing Data to select data partners for the purpose of targeting advertising to VIZIO TVs or other digital devices that share the IP address of VIZIO TVs, based on viewing history collected from that TV. VIZIO or its data partners are sometimes authorized to enhance Viewing Data with household demographic data and data about digital actions (e.g. digital purchases, location, and other consumer behavior taken by devices associated with the IP Address VIZIO collects), for the purpose of delivering relevant advertising that are likely to be useful or timely, including during broadcast, cable, satellite, or internet based television programming   VIZIO does not permit data partners to combine or associate the Viewing Data with any information that will result in the Viewing Data becoming identifiable to individual customers.  VIZIO may combine information (including Activity Data or Viewing Data) collected with other information so that VIZIO can provide, market, and improve VIZIO’s products and services – such as by enhancing popular product functionality and by modifying services to better meet VIZIO’s customers’ needs. VIZIO may also match your data with VIZIO’s partners’ data to help market VIZIO’s products or services to you and provide advertising tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.  Other Circumstances for Disclosing Information . VIZIO will disclose information as required by law, or if any of the following applies in VIZIO’s judgment:   It is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena).  The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed.  An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person, or it is necessary to protect the rights or property of VIZIO or VIZIO’s employees.  If the ownership of VIZIO, Inc. or an affiliate or their respective assets changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, information may be transferred to another company. That company may only use information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   International Transfers .  VIZIO is a company located in Irvine, California in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information VIZIO collects may be processed and transferred to the United States and be subject to U.S. law.  By using VIZIO products and services or providing VIZIO with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance, and transfer of such information to and in the U.S.    IV.  Consumer Controls for the Handling of Information  Controlling Your Email Marketing Choices. You may opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by following the instructions in those messages (often it will be a notice or link at the bottom of the message). If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails, such as emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you, or, as allowed by applicable law.  Controlling How SmartCast Products Collect Your Data. You are not required to create a personal account to use your SmartCast Products.  You may use your SmartCast Products and services (a) without registering the product to your name and email address, (b) by using the SmartCast Mobile App in Guest Mode, and/or (c) without using the SmartCast Mobile App at all. As described below, in Guest Mode, VIZIO may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with a SmartCast Product even though VIZIO does not know who you are.  Users of SmartCast products and services have a number of ways to control information connected with your device:   SmartCast Mobile App – myVIZIO. You may use your myVIZIO account to connect to the SmartCast Mobile App. You may also sign into the SmartCast Mobile App using a social networking credential (such as Facebook).  SmartCast Mobile App – Guest Mode. You can operate your SmartCast Mobile App in Guest Mode. To do so, pair the tablet that may be included in the box or your own device with the SmartCast display, and choose to proceed in the SmartCast Mobile App in guest mode.  In that circumstance, VIZIO will create a guest profile and deliver personalization of content and other SmartCast Mobile App features and functionality, but VIZIO will not associate your Activity Data or (when and if enabled) any Viewing Data with any myVIZIO account or user profile name.  SmartCast TV or Display.  Prior to collecting Activity Data, the SmartCast TV applications will show a notification explaining the nature and purpose of the Activity Data collection, separate and apart from this Privacy Policy.  Disabling Automated Content Recognition (“ACR”)/Viewing Data. Prior to enabling Viewing Data collection on your SmartCast TV or display, VIZIO will request your express acknowledgment and acceptance.  Only upon acknowledgment and acceptance will VIZIO collect Viewing Data from your SmartCast TV or display.  Each unit will receive a notification, explaining the nature and purpose of the feature, separate and apart from this Privacy Policy. Viewing Data will only be collected from units that choose to “AGREE” to collection and use of Viewing Data. Thereafter, at that time, and any time after, you will have the option to change the setting for the ACR feature/Viewing Data collection off or on from the Settings menu of your VIZIO device. Turning if off will not affect the performance of your VIZIO device but will trigger the deletion of historical logs of Viewing Data for the device from VIZIO’s data base.   Controlling the Collection of Viewing Data. For textual as well as graphical instructions on how to turn Viewing Data off or on, visit http://www.vizio.com/viewingdata .  If you are unable to locate the Viewing Data setting on your VIZIO TV or display, contact VIZIO customer service by emailing privacy@vizio.com or calling (855) 472-8817.  Please note that if your TV or display is ever reset to factory settings, the device will return to its default settings, and Viewing Data will be reset to the “OFF” position.  You may again turn the feature on by following the procedure described above.  Turning the Viewing Data feature off or on will affect only the TV or display where you have made that selection. When you turn off collection of Viewing Data (if it was previously turned on), logs of Viewing Data will be deleted from our database.  However, even if Viewing Data is turned off, information other than Viewing Data will still be collected from you when you separately provide such information, such as when you submit a support request or participate in a promotion and from other sources as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.  REMINDER : You always have the option to control the collection of Viewing Data in your TV or display’s Settings menu. Viewing Data collection is only enabled if a user AGREES to this collection.  However, for a period of time you may continue to see tailored ads on other devices that were targeted on the basis of Viewing Data that was shared before you turned off collection.  Disabling the Video ACR (Viewing Data) feature in the Settings Menu will not, however, affect or limit Activity Data collection through SmartCast Products, which is used to personalize and recommend content within the SmartCast TV, display or SmartCast Mobile App. If you intend to sell or otherwise give away your VIZIO TV or display, you should perform a “factory reset.”   How You Can Access or Remove Information. If you desire access to view, correct or remove information, please call (855) 472-8817.  If you request removal of personal information, you acknowledge that residual information may continue to reside in VIZIO’s records and archives, but VIZIO will not use that information going forward for commercial purposes. VIZIO reserves the right to maintain information if VIZIO has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to the VIZIO site or VIZIO products and services for violating any applicable Terms of Use or Terms of Service. This paragraph does not apply to information that cannot be reasonably used to identify you. VIZIO reserves the right to refuse to process data removal requests that are impractical or jeopardize the privacy of others.

VIZIO will retain information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine VIZIO’s retention periods include: (i) the length of time VIZIO has an ongoing relationship with the customer and provide VIZIO’s products and services; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which VIZIO is subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of VIZIO’s legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations). Please note that if when you turn off collection of Viewing Data (if it was previously turned on), logs of Viewing Data will be deleted from our database.  How VIZIO Protects the Information Collected . VIZIO uses reasonable and appropriate measures to protect information within VIZIO’s organization.  Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  To help protect your information, we recommend consumers follow best practices for internet activities, including proactive password management and router security protocols .    Handling of Minors’ Data . VIZIO recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase VIZIO’s products for family use, including use by minors. VIZIO will not knowingly sell information from children under age 13 for any purpose nor will VIZIO knowingly accept registration from them.  In some cases, particularly where information is collected electronically, VIZIO may not be able to know whether information was collected from a child under age 13. VIZIO treats this information as though it were provided by an adult.  However, if VIZIO learns that it has collected information of a child under age 13, VIZIO will attempt to delete that information as soon as possible and take any other measures required under applicable law.
