We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). Terms used in this CCPA Privacy Policy, such as personal information, consumers, and service providers, have the same meaning as they are defined in the CCPA.  Summary of CCPA Privacy Policy  Please read this entire Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information. The following points summarize some of the important details discussed below:   Under the CCPA, a California consumer has the right to request that MassMutual disclose what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell. Note, however, that MassMutual does not sell personal information.  Under the CCPA, a California consumer also has the right to request that MassMutual delete the personal information we have collected from the consumer.  Not all of your personal information is subject to the CCPA. Notably, if you are a MassMutual customer, your personal information may be subject to other privacy laws and your personal information that MassMutual maintains may be exempt from the CCPA. Your rights under other applicable privacy laws are described in our online privacy notice and customer privacy notices, which can be found at www.massmutual.com/legal/privacy .  California consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by MassMutual for the exercise of their privacy rights under the CCPA.   What is Personal Information?  The CCPA provides personal information rights to California residents. The CCPA defines personal information as information that “identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular” California consumer or household. Personal information does not include publicly available information or consumer information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.  What Personal Information Does MassMutual Collect, for What Purpose, from Whom, and Do We Disclose it to Service Providers?
