Your use of our Services constitutes your consent to these practices. Information That We Collect or Receive We collect and receive information from and about you by different means. Information You Provide to Us We collect the information that you directly provide to us, such as when you enter it on a web page, or include it in an email that you send to us. This type of collection often occurs through our business support processes, such as: Registration or Account Creation Processes, where we ask you to provide information such as: Contact info (e.g. name, email or mailing address, or phone number); Account Administration Info (e.g. user name, password, or security questions); Billing Info (e.g. credit card or other payment number, billing address); and Profile Info (e.g. profile photo, languages, likes) Purchase Processes, where we may ask you to provide your name, contact and billing info Technical and Customer Support Processes, where we may ask you to provide contact info and information related to the issue you are contacting us about. In addition, we collect the information that you provide by entering it into certain Service features. For example, when you want to post in a forum, you provide us the content for the post (which could contain personally identifying information) which we collect and then display for you on the forum. Likewise, when you use other features such as voice or text messaging, blogs, surveys, user-generated content, activity streams, or social media, we may first collect the information you enter into the feature. Automatic Information Collection We may also automatically or passively collect information about your use of our Services. While information collected in this manner is not typically personal information, we may combine it in ways that make it personally identifiable. When we do so, we will treat the combined information as personal information. For example, data collected in this manner may include: Web browsing, network or service usage data, such as browser type, internet service provider (ISP), IP address, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data; Network connected hardware (e.g. computer, gaming console, or mobile device) data, such as a unique device identifier, type, model, version, error related data, status, capability, configuration, functionality, performance data, and connection type; Network connected software data, such as application utilization, game play, game or system video and audio, progress, utilization, performance, peripheral and device use, services requested and used, or content downloaded and viewed; Physical or geographic location data, such as country, region, city, or latitude and longitude. For example, to provide location based game matching services, we may collect latitude and longitude. Advertising data, such as display frequency, duration, location, or viewing software, or identifier. Technologies used in our Services to passively collect such information may include: Cookies. Small data files placed on a devices hard drive. Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons, (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included on our websites or in our e-mail messages. Embedded Scripts. Programming code that is temporarily downloaded onto a device, and is active only while you are connected to our website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. In addition, our Services may use a variety of other hardware or software specific technologies that automatically collect information. (For example, a location based game might include technology that automatically determines the user's location). Information We Receive From Third Parties We may also supplement the information that we collect with information that we obtain from third parties. For example, if you link your Account on PSN ("Account") to your game, social media, or other accounts, we may receive data from the providers of those accounts. Likewise, if other users give us access to their profiles, we may receive information about you if you are one of their connections or information about you is otherwise accessible through their profile. Alternatively, we may supplement the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with the information we directly collect, in which case we will handle it in accordance with this policy. Information Use We use non-personally identifying information without restriction. We use personally identifying information ("PII") in a number of ways. First, we use PII for the purpose for which it was collected. For example, PII that you provide through any of our business support processes (including customer service) will be used to complete that process, and personal information entered by you through the features of our products and services will be used for the operation and delivery of those features. Second, while we strive to minimize our use of PII, or otherwise anonymize or aggregate it before use, we may use personal information to: Send you marketing communications; Conduct demographic or aggregate studies for marketing, sales, planning, and business and product development; Provide requested products and services such as online video, music or video game services; Deliver contextual or targeted advertising; Understand and improve our Service operations and performance Assist in customer service and transactions Security & Legal In order to help protect you and others, we may use the data we collect and receive in order to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of and investigate and/or prosecute any potential threat to or misuse of our Services; ensure compliance with the applicable terms of service, privacy policy, and law; investigate violations of or enforce these agreements; and protect the rights and property of Sony, its partners, and customers.

Children We are committed to respecting children's privacy. We will not collect personal information from anyone we have actual knowledge is under the age of 13, without their parent's consent. With parental consent, we will collect, use and share information collected from or about children in accordance with the practices described in this document, with the following exceptions: Information You Provide To Us: A parent only needs to provide limited information about their child (an email address and date-of-birth) to create an Account for their child. Providing gender is optional. Language, state, and country are initially inherited from the parent's Account. Only with the parent's approval to create an Account for the child, can a child add their address, or an online ID. The spending limit of the Account for your child is set by the associated parent's Account. Information You May Choose to Share A parent can control, through the 'restrict chat' setting on their child's Account, their child's ability to use (and share personal information through) text chat, voice chat, video chat, and other messaging features from communicating directly with other users in games, apps or via system software features. Please note that a child's Account can still A) send and receive predetermined text messages created by a game or app, B) create and see other users' in-game character names, designs, and clan titles, C) use communication services via an Internet browser unless specifically disabled and D) communicate via system messaging on PS3 and PS Vita. A parent can control their child's ability to post or view user-generated content, including photos, videos, drawings, and content imported from outside sources (any of which might contain personal information) through the user-generated content control. (This will not prevent video capture of a child Account user's online gameplay). A parent can agree to our collection and use of their child's PII without consenting to our disclosure to third parties, except when the disclosure is inherent to the Services we are providing. When a parent allows their child's Account to participate in games, chat or user-generated content features, they also consent to SIE LLC sharing information with the publishers of the games, applications, or services that incorporate those features and the collection of information entered into such features by the child's Account (e.g. typing text into the chat feature). If you discover your child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without your consent, once we verify you are the child's parent, we will promptly: (a) provide direct notice to you indicating what, if any, personal information of your child has been collected and how it has been used or disclosed; (b) remove and cease the use of your child's personal information or other information from our database and (c) by notice to you, confirm compliance with the foregoing.
