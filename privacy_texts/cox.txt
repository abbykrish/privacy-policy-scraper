What is CCPA?         The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a privacy law that gives California residents additional rights and protection regarding their online data and personal Information.  The law goes into effect in January 2020 and gives California consumers the following rights:    Right to know what personal information is collected about them    Right to know how their personal information is being used    Right to access a copy of their personal information    Right to request that a business delete the personal information that was collected from them, unless needed for business purposes    Right to say no to having their personal information sold to third-parties            What is considered personal information?         CCPA defines personal information as any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.   Examples include, a name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, Internet activity, geolocation data and other similar identifiers.  Publicly available information from government sources is not personal information under CCPA.           What personal information do we collect?         We collect personal information that helps us manage your accounts and services, as well as create and deliver a great customer experience.  We collect different information about you based on your relationship with us, including:     Basic information that’s needed to set up your service, including name, address, telephone numbers, social security number, driver’s license number, email addresses, passwords, credit score, and demographic information.    Financial information like banking and credit card details that allow you to pay and manage your account quickly and easily.    Equipment and device information, and depending on the services you subscribe to, service activity information like how much Internet data your household uses each month, the channels you watch, how often you watch a pay-per-view movie, phone records, settings and preferences, home security and automation settings, as well as MAC addresses and IP addresses of devices.    Information about how you use our services, including: records of the communications between us; any maintenance and repair work we’ve completed; your feedback on the services we’ve delivered; fraud prevention, and information relating to our network for quality and network protection.    Marketing preferences like how you prefer to receive communications, what types of information you’re interested in receiving, and any opt-outs you have chosen.    We use cookies on our websites to collect information and track performance that informs how we build our online experience and message to customers and potential customers.  This information allows us to remember you when you visit; tells us whether or not you’re within our serviceable footprint; enables us to provide targeted advertisements and recommendations for pricing, promotions, and products that are best suited to you; helps us make suggestions about programming that may be relevant or of interest; and helps us know when we need to notify you about things that may impact your account like when there’s an outage in your area or when your next payment is due.    In our apps, we collect information to: o    allow you to make payments and view current billing information o    monitor operational/performance evaluation and user analytics, o    identify behavior trends to evaluate effectiveness of self-service features o    provide chat with Cox Customer Care agents o    know your device location to enable you to use the store locator and to verify your device location for TV channel listings o    check your service health and data usage      We also collect demographic information to help us better understand the households we serve.  We use it to help us serve up relevant offers and information that you may be interested in.            How do we use your personal information?         We use your personal information for different purposes depending on our relationship, but overall, we use it to help us deliver services and create a great customer experience, including:    To best manage our relationship with you and to improve your experience.    To personalize the products and service offers and information we send to you.    To contact you for marketing purposes, marketing research or in relation to your accounts or a question you’ve raised with us.    To advertise and market products and services that we think you might like.    To allow advertisers to reach you with their products and services            Where do we get your personal information?         We collect personal information directly from you as well as from third-party vendors and service providers, including data brokers.           Do we have personal information if you never had Cox services?         If you never had Cox services, we may still have limited personal information about your household.  Typically, this would be demographic information that we collect from third-party vendors and service providers that we use to market our services to you.           How do you find out what personal information we have about you?         By submitting a request for a Personal Information Report.  If you are a current or former Cox customer, the Account Holder for your account can submit a request for a Personal Information Report using their Cox account credentials.  We take the protection of your data seriously and use multi-factor authentication to verify your identity for CCPA purposes.  As part of this process, we will send you a verification code. Our preferred method is to text the code to a mobile number listed on your Cox account, but we can also email the code to a non-Cox email address.  We ask for a non-Cox email address as an added measure of security to verify your identity to ensure that the email account credentials used to obtain the code are separate and distinct from the credentials used to log in to your Cox account.  As a reminder, to keep your accounts secure, you should have different credentials for different accounts and avoid reusing usernames and passwords on different accounts.  If you are a former customer without Cox credentials, or you have never been a Cox customer but live in our service area, we will verify your identity using an independent verification service.  You will be asked a series of questions that only you would typically be able to answer.   If we are not able to verify your identity with high confidence, we will only be able to provide you with generic information on the categories of information we collect and how we use it.   If you have lived at more than one address in a Cox service area in the last 12 months, you will need to submit a separate request for a Personal Information Report for each address.   You can submit a request by going to this webpage .           Who can request a Personal Information Report?         Only California consumers or residents of California (generally those who pay CA state income tax) are eligible to make a CCPA request.  Consumers can make the request themselves or authorize an agent (another person or business registered with the California Secretary of State) to make CCPA requests on their behalf.  If a consumer uses an agent, the agent may initiate the request by filling out the form, but only the consumer is permitted to set up username and password credentials and receive the Personal Information Report.           How often can you request a Personal Information Report?         Each consumer can make two Personal Information Report access requests in a twelve-month period.            Is there a cost to request a Personal Information Report?         No, there’s no cost. However, if your request is unreasonable or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a fee or refuse your request.             What personal information do we delete?         California consumers can ask us to delete personal information that we collected directly from them as long as we no longer need it for any business purpose.  Based on our business uses, we won’t delete a lot of personal information, but we take seriously the responsibility of protecting the information you share with us.  The information we collect from you is needed for billing and payments, marketing and advertising, customer care support and troubleshooting, legal process, fraud prevention, and to improve our services and experience.            Do we sell personal information that includes your name and address?         No, we don’t sell any personal information that includes names and addresses.           Do we sell other personal information?         We share TV viewership information without including personal information like names and addresses – with third parties, including networks and programmers, that use it in order to better understand how different networks, channels and programs are performing among TV viewers.  This information is also used by advertisers to help them make decisions on where to place their ads.  Even though we don’t connect the TV viewership data with your name and address, because we use a household identifier it is still considered personal information and a sale under the unique definition of sale in the CCPA.  We want to give you choice on how your information is used, so we provide you a way to opt out of the sale of TV viewership information by going to the Privacy Preferences in My Account.            Do we use cookies or online trackers?         Yes, we use cookies, tags, and pixels to help us provide useful features to simplify your experience when you return to our sites and applications; deliver relevant content and advertising based on your preferences, usage patterns and location; monitor and optimize the use and operation of our sites and applications, and analyze traffic on our sites and on the sites of third parties.  We do not consider this to be a sale under CCPA but there is not yet a consensus on this topic We are looking into methods to offer online control to our users.  In the meantime, please see our cookie information page for a list of resources that you may use to control cookies and tags.           I am an authorized agent.  How do I submit a request on behalf of a consumer?         Authorized agents may submit CCPA requests by completing the form at this link .  Once received, we will contact the consumer with instructions on how to validate and complete the request process.  Responses may be received by web or paper mail, as with any other request.            I’m having trouble making a request on the CCPA website.  What should I do?         We’re here to help.  Please send an email to californiaprivacy@cox.com or call + 1(800)-699-0885 .           Why can't I use my cox.net address to receive a verification code?         Cox takes your data privacy seriously.  For added security, we do not send verification codes  to cox.net email addresses.  Customers may add an additional email address or mobile number to their My Account profile to receive verification codes, but codes sent to the added contact address or number cannot immediately be used.  These measures are in place for account security purposes.           What is the difference between submitting a Do Not Sell opt-out request and updating my communication preferences?         Under CCPA, “opt out” is a request relating to the sale of personal information to third parties; however, a customer may still receive marketing materials directly from Cox.  If you are no longer interested in receiving information from us on our products and services, current and former customers can update their communication preferences in My Account here .           What should I do if Cox’s third-party identity verification is unable to identify me?         Consumers who have questions, concerns, or want more information about the results of their Equifax identity check should contact Equifax directly using the information below:  P.O. Box 105832 Atlanta, GA 30348-5832 Phone: 1-888-259-2689           What is the Right to Opt Out?         Under CCPA, the right to opt out allows you to tell us not to sell your personal information.  We sell very little personal information and never with your name and address.  We share TV viewership information that omits personal information like names and addresses, with third parties.  Networks and programmers use this information to better understand how different networks, channels and programs are performing among TV viewers.  This information is also used by advertisers to help them make decisions on where to place their ads.  Even though we don’t connect the TV viewership information with your name and address, because we use a household identifier, it is still considered personal information and a sale.  Separate from CCPA, Cox TV customers may always opt-out of Cox sharing their TV viewership information with third parties by updating their privacy settings here .  In addition, some of the cookies or tags we use in our websites and apps may be considered a sale of personal information under CCPA although here is not a consensus on this topic. Please see our cookie information page for resources on managing cookies and tags.   Opting Out of Sale does not mean you will stop receiving marketing materials from Cox but we do offer a way for you to manage marketing communications.  If you want to stop receiving marketing communications from Cox on our products and services, current and formers customers can access these settings in My Account here .
