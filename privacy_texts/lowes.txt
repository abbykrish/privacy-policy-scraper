When we're not legally required to do so, we strive to comply with reasonable requests, but there may be a delay in processing such requests. To make privacy requests, please complete the form below or call 1-800-309-5732.   For your privacy and security, we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests.   To exercise other privacy choices, such as opting-out from email marketing, text messaging, or deactivating your MyLowe's account, please visit here .       Access My Personal Information  You may request a copy of your personal information and learn more about our information collection, use and sharing practices.     Delete My Personal Information  You may request that Lowe's delete your personal information. This may impact our capability to provide products or services to you. We will, however, keep certain information when permitted by law.     Restrict Certain Sharing of My Information ("Opt-out from Sale")   We do not sell personal information for payment or discount. We use certain advertising cookies to serve targeted online ads and to measure its effectiveness. We may also disclose your information to our business partners who may use it for additional purposes relevant to our products or services (e.g. joint marketing, joint product/services offering). These disclosures may be deemed as a “sale” under the CCPA if such disclosure is for any valuable consideration, even if we don’t receive any payment or discount. You can opt-out here, but remember also visiting Lowe’s Privacy Statement to adjust cookie preference for online targeted ads.         Access My Personal Information   You may obtain a copy of your personal information to learn more about the categories and the specific piece of personal information collected about you, the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, and the categories of entities with whom we share personal information. You can also learn about categories of personal information shared with third parties that may be defined as a “sale” under the California law, even if we receive no payment or discount.           Delete My Personal Information   You may request that Lowe's delete your personal information. Deleting your personal information will result your MyLowe's account being closed, and may impact our capability to provide products or services to you. Please note we need to keep certain information when permitted by law for the purpose of completing transactions, preventing fraud or for internal and lawful purposes.           Restrict Certain Sharing of My Information ("Opt-out from Sale")   We don't disclose your personal information to other businesses for monetary considerations. But in limited cases, we may disclose information about you to a third party who may also use the information for their own specific purpose. If such disclosure is for any valuable consideration, it's defined as a "sale" under the California Consumer Privacy Act. You may request opting out from such data sharing, which is called "opt-out from sale" right if you are a California resident.  If you choose this option, we will stop sharing your information with certain business partners whereby the data sharing may be considered as a “sale” under the California Consumer Privacy Act, such as a business partner who jointly provides a product or service to you. We also use cookies and tracking technologies for online targeted advertising, and you will need to separately adjust cookie preference here. Opting out from online, interest-based and targeted advertising is associated with the browser that you use to set those preferences, not with you as an individual.
