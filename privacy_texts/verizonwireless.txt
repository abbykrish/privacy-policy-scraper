Verizon Residential customers : Visit our Wireline California Consumer Protection Act FAQs to learn about your rights as a Verizon Wireless customer and how to use the Verizon Privacy Dashboard.          General Information       What are my rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)?      If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives you the right to know what information companies collect about you and the right to access and delete that information within certain limitations. You also have the right to tell companies not to sell personal information about you. Companies may not discriminate against you for invoking these rights.  For more information, please visit the privacy policy .  Because your privacy is important to us, we've created the Verizon Privacy Dashboard so you can exercise these rights at your convenience.               What is the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      The Verizon Privacy Dashboard is our online portal where you can exercise your privacy rights. You can sign in to the Verizon Privacy Dashboard to:   Preview certain categories of my information   Download a portable copy of my information  Delete some of my personal information                Who can use the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      Current and former Verizon customers can use the Verizon Privacy Dashboard or call our dedicated privacy toll-free number at (800) 333-3972 to manage your personal information. What if I don't have a Verizon account?   Former Verizon Customers  If you're a former Verizon customer, you can submit a request to view personal information that we have associated with you or your account. However, once you've disconnected service, Verizon can't verify your connection to specific phone lines or the personal information associated with those lines. Because the phone numbers may have changed after you terminated your service with Verizon, we may not be able to provide information about the line(s) you previously had with us.   Multiple Verizon Accounts  If you have multiple Verizon accounts such as Wireless Postpaid, Wireless Prepaid, Fios, Cloud, or Smart Family, you'll need to sign in to each account and make separate requests.               Is there a Spanish version of the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      Currently, the Verizon Privacy Dashboard is offered in English. We plan to offer a Spanish version in the future. Please check back for updates.                 Using the Verizon Privacy Dashboard       How do I view my personal information in the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      To view your personal information:   Sign in to the Verizon Privacy Dashboard . Under the "Your Personal Information" section, you'll see the following categories of information:  Account and Identity - Information that allows us to recognize you and your account.  Network and customer activity - Information you generate when you use or interact with our products and services.  Third-party insights - Information about you and your activities that we use to personalize your experiences and offers.  Add-ons - Information from additional products and features included in your account.    Tap or click on a category to begin viewing your personal information related to that category.  Note: If you don't have a Verizon account, you will not be able to preview your personal information directly in the Verizon Privacy Dashboard. However, you will be able to request a download of your personal information after verifying your identity.                How do I download a portable copy of my information from the Verizon Privacy Dashboard and how long does it take?      Note: If you're not on an Unlimited data plan, we suggest downloading your information over a secure Wi-Fi network to avoid consuming your available data.  To download your information:   Visit the Verizon Privacy Dashboard and sign in.  Select Download personal information in the "Information requests" section. You can download up to 12 months worth of your data.  For your security we will send an authentication code to the email or mobile telephone number associated with your account. Enter this code when requested to verify your identity.   You'll be given the option to request either a standard download or an advanced download. Why are there two download options?  The main categories of information that can be downloaded are:   Account and Identity - Information that allows us to recognize you and your account.  Network and customer activity - Information you generate when you use or interact with our products and services.  Third-party insights - Information about you and your activities that we use to personalize your experiences and offers.  Add-ons - Information from additional products and features included in your account.   Once you've completed your request you'll see a confirmation notice on your screen. When your download is ready you'll receive a text message notification. If you're unable to receive a text message notification, you'll receive an update by email if we have your email address on file.   Opening the file  The download file will be encrypted and password-protected. When your download is ready, a temporary password will be sent to your device. You will need the password to view your file. When the download is ready, it will be available as a JSON or CSV file. A "JSON" file stands for "JavaScript Object Notation" file. It is a standard and simplistic format that is used primarily to transmit information between a server and a web application. A CSV file is a file format that is used to store tabular based data. CSV files can be imported into a spreadsheet in Microsoft Office, OpenOffice or Google Sheets. Both formats are easy to use and transfer. Learn how to download JSON files.  It may take approximately 45 days for you to hear from Verizon. We'll notify you when the download is ready. For your protection, your download file will automatically expire after 15 days. Once it expires you'll need to submit a new request.   Cancelling a request  You can cancel your request at any time as long as the file isn't ready. Once the file is ready, you can only delete it.               How do I delete my personal information in the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      To delete your information, visit the Verizon Privacy Dashboard , sign in with your credentials and select Delete your personal information in the "Information requests" section. You can also call our dedicated privacy toll-free number at (800) 333-3972 to request that we delete your personal information. Once you delete your personal information, Verizon will stop collecting the categories of information that you deleted. You cannot recover your information once it's been deleted.  The Account Owner or Account Manager cannot delete information for all lines on the account, but he or she can remove all lines of the account from relevant advertising programs. If you would like to continue to participate in these programs, you can opt back in from the "Control" section of the Verizon Privacy Dashboard.  For those who use other lines on your account, we may have information about them that's not associated with an existing account if they are 18 years or older. If they're an account member or a site visitor, they can download and delete personal information that's not associated with your account by continuing as a guest in the Privacy Dashboard. This will require them to provide additional information so we can verify that it is the right person making the request.  Once you've elected to delete your personal information, it will be permanently deleted from our systems and can't be recovered.  If you delete your information you'll still receive promotions and discount offers from Verizon. Depending on the type of information that's deleted, the discounts and promotions offered to you may be less personalized and not as relevant to your interests.  We will keep information that we need to provide and bill you for services, detect fraud, debug or repair our network or detect security threats, meet legal and regulatory obligations, or for other internal business operational purposes. We also keep financial information related to collections and credit bureaus. For example, we need to retain your account information to bill you and to offer you support.               How do I update my privacy choices in the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      You can update your privacy settings by signing into the My Verizon portal . After signing in using your credentials, you can change your privacy settings.  Wireless Postpaid customers also have the option to update privacy settings by signing into the Verizon Privacy Dashboard and selecting Manage your privacy settings in the "Control" section. The privacy settings are also available through your My Verizon account.  If you're the Account Owner you can update the privacy choices for all lines on your account. If you're an Account Member you can update the privacy choices for your own account, but not for all lines on your account.               As a Verizon business customer, can I request a copy of the Personal Information about my consumers if they request it from me?      Yes, you can request access to personal information about your consumers that is in Verizon's systems because of the services Verizon provides your business. Your administrator or point of contact (POC) on your Verizon account can submit these requests through the Verizon portals you use to administer your account (e.g., Verizon Enterprise Center). Verizon will provide your administrator/POC any personal information that is in Verizon's systems related to that request for any time period within the 12 months prior to the date the request is made, free of charge and in a readily usable JSON format.               How do I view the JSON file I downloaded from the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      You can view JSON files on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux with the Firefox browser using the JSONView add-on. For instructions specific to your computer refer to your OS below.  Note: If you're not on an Unlimited data plan, we suggest downloading your information over a secure Wi-Fi network to avoid consuming your available data.   Windows   Unzip the file using a 3rd-party software such as WinZip. This software is available for free from several sources. Please make sure that you download from a reputable and safe website. Once the file is unzipped, please make sure that the file is kept secure and is not shared with anyone.  Open the JSON files with a text editor like Notepad, WordPad or Altova XMLSpy to view the contents.  Right-click on the file and then choose Open With from the drop-down menu.  Click on Notepad (or other text editor) in the submenu. If your text editor is not listed, click Browse to find it.   Mac OS X  Open the JSON files using Apple TextEdit or other compatible text editor which will allow you to view the contents. You can also use Bare Bones TextWrangler which is a text and HTML editor designed for Mac PCs or MacVim designed for Mac OS X.   Linux  Open and view JSON files with Vim for Linux, which is a highly configurable text editor, or you can use another editor such as Pico or GNU Emacs.                 Understanding the Verizon Privacy Dashboard       Why are there two download options: Standard and Advanced, and what is the difference?      There are two download options available when you request your data from Verizon: Standard and Advanced. For your privacy and security, highly sensitive information such as your credit card information, Social Security number, and passwords will not be displayed in any download file.   Standard download (recommended): A standard download includes the personal information that Verizon has about you, but for safety and security, this download will not include more sensitive personal information. You can make up to 10 standard download requests in a 12 month period.  Advanced download : An advanced download includes everything in your standard download plus more sensitive information. For security reasons, it will take longer for Verizon to process an advanced download, and you‚Äôll have to submit a consent form acknowledging that you understand the risk. You can submit the consent form through the Verizon Privacy Dashboard after you verify your identity and make your request for an advanced download. You can make up to 2 Advanced download requests in a 12 month period.                Why is some of my information masked in the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      For your security, some of the information displayed on the Verizon Privacy Dashboard will be masked. Some masked information will be displayed if you download a copy of your personal information. However, highly sensitive information, such as your credit card information, Social Security number, and passwords, will not be displayed in either the Dashboard or a download file.  Guest users who don't have an account with Verizon will not be able to preview their personal information directly in the Verizon Privacy Dashboard. However, they will be able to request a download of their personal information after verifying their identity.               How will submitting a request impact me as a customer and is there a charge?      Verizon does not discriminate against consumers who exercise their rights. You can submit a request, free of charge, through the Verizon Privacy Dashboard or by calling our Toll Free Number at (800) 333-3972.  However, your experience may be impacted if you change your privacy settings or delete certain information. For example, you may not receive certain targeted marketing promotions, and you may receive less personalized content. To learn more, visit the Verizon Privacy Dashboard .               How do I opt out of the sale of my personal information?      Verizon does not sell information that directly identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address. In some cases we are required by law to share certain directory assistance information with other wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers.  Nevada customers have the legal right to opt out of the sale of their personal information, even if their information isn't currently being sold. For more information about how Verizon shared your information and when and how you may opt out of sharing, visit the Do I have specific rights under the privacy laws in the United States? section of our privacy policy.               Can I alter the information I have received from my download request?      No, you cannot change any of the values within the download file, you may only request to have this information deleted. However, information specifically related to your account can be edited by accessing your profile settings within the account tab featured on the My Verizon portal (e.g., home address, password, and billing information).               Why does my download file not include biometric information?      Verizon stores limited biometric information which we do not disclose to protect your security because this information is generally used to identify customers or as a password that allows customers to access their account.               Why do I see call information on my download that does not appear on my bill?      Your bill includes calls that reach a full connection and are billed. Your download file may include calls that did not reach a full connection, such as calls that were placed but not answered, and calls that are not billed, such as calls to toll-free numbers and 911.               Why does Verizon collect information about my interests from advertising partners?      We rely on information about your interests that we get from third party advertising partners to help us develop new products and services of interest to you, to personalize the content and offers you receive from us, and to customize your Verizon experience.  When you delete it, we permanently delete and stop collecting this information. You'll continue to see advertising content from us, but it may feel less personalized or relevant to you.               If I'm an Account Owner, can I request to download information for each line on my account?      An Account Owner can access certain information about all of the lines on his or her account using their account log-in at Verizonwireless.com, through the My Verizon App, or via the Verizon Privacy Dashboard. For example, the information available includes the phone numbers and devices on the account, call histories, and data usage. To protect individual privacy, an Account Owner may only access sensitive information for other lines on the account if the Account Owner has access to that device.               I purchased and activated a phone through an authorized retail store, other than Verizon, can I still make a request to access my personal information?      Yes, you can still make a request for your personal information from Verizon. We will respond to your request with information that we have collected about you or your account. Other retail locations or "Authorized Retailers" are not directly owned by Verizon, and these stores may have independently collected personal information from you that Verizon did not collect, and does not receive. If you have questions regarding any personal information not included in your download that may have been collected by these stores, please contact them directly.               If I'm a former Verizon Wireless customer, can I submit a request?      As a former customer, you can submit a request to view personal information that Verizon may still have on file. However, once you've disconnected service, Verizon can't verify your connection to specific phone lines or the personal information associated with those lines. Because the phone numbers may have changed after you terminated your service with Verizon, we may not be able to provide information about the line(s) you previously had with us.               If I don't have an account with Verizon, what documents can I submit to verify my identity?      To identify who you are if you request information as a guest, we need basic information about you, including your name and address. We also require a method of contact such as a phone number or email address for notifications, and to reconfirm it's you when you return. We then need documentation that shows your identity to verify that you have the authority to make a request. Currently, acceptable forms of documentation include a driver's license or a state ID. All documentation needs to be submitted via the Verizon Privacy Dashboard using a laptop/desktop computer only by accessing the Dashboard as a guest. Mobile versions of this process are not yet supported.

We also keep financial information related to collections and credit bureaus.               Why was Verizon unable to verify the documentation I submitted to the Verizon Privacy Dashboard?      Verizon was unable to verify your identity based on your ID. It's possible that the name and address on the document didn't match the details filled out online, the quality of the image provided was poor, or the document wasn't verified as legitimate. Please try again if you believe this is an error.  Sometimes documents aren't accepted due to image capture issues, which can happen when using the web portal to submit your documents instead of using the app. The app can guide you on how to capture a clear image of the document to verify your identity. Please make sure the image fits within all four corners of the screen where indicated.
