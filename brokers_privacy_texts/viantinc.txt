Viant Technology LLC is a digital media company comprised of a family of companies that includes Viant US LLC and Adelphic LLC (“Adelphic”), (collectively, “Viant,” “we,” or “us”). Viant is the owner of a cloud-based advertising platform and provides services to publishers, advertisers and other companies (our “Clients”) that allow them to plan and execute interest-based digital media campaigns and measure the performance of those campaigns (the “Viant Services”).  1. Scope  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use and otherwise process personal information (sometimes referred to as “data”) about visitors of our websites (the “Sites”) and from other sources that we make available to our Clients through the Viant Services (collectively, the Sites and Viant Services are the “Services”). This Policy does not apply to information we collect and process through Myspace LLC. The privacy policy and privacy notice for Myspace are located here and here . Please note that our business is generally not targeted at consumers but other businesses (i.e., our Clients) and when we act as a service provider on behalf of our Clients, we collect, use, and disclose the relevant personal information only under the business’ instruction, and their privacy policy will apply to how they (and we on their behalf) process personal information.  Please read this entire Policy carefully. This Policy contains links that you can click on to get further information or exercise the options you have about your information. To make this Policy more reader-friendly, we use everyday words such as use, transfer and storage to describe what we do with your personal information – but this Policy covers all our data processing activities. By partnering with us as Client or visiting the Site and/or otherwise using the Viant Services or Services, you agree to the terms of this Policy.  Some of the key topics you may be interested in include:   Information we collect  How we use information  How we share, and disclose information  EEA Data Subject Rights  Children’s information  How we secure your information  How long we keep your information  Cross-border transfers of information  This policy may change  Contact information  Additional privacy rights for California residents   2. Information We Collect  We generally collect online and offline information about consumers’ interests and habits through web tracking technologies, and from our other business partners like data providers, ad exchanges, and mobile app attribution companies (our “Ad Partners”). We use that information to create audience segments that we make available to our Clients to enable them to deliver targeted, interest-based advertising and to conduct analytics and research. The Viant Services deliver the targeted advertising messages to consumers (the “Users”) on computers, mobile phones and similar devices and enable us to report back to our Clients about the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns.  A. Personal information we collect directly from you  Viant generally does not collect personal information regarding individual Users through the Viant Services. However, we may collect certain personal information via the Sites about you, for example if you contact us, such as by submitting a question, downloading a whitepaper or registering to use the Viant Services. However, in most cases, if and/or when we obtain personal information, it relates to our current or prospective clients and business partners.  To the extent we receive personal information through our Services, we use personal information only in ways compatible with the purposes set out in this Policy, such as to respond to email communications or questions, improve our products and services, develop new products, services, and features, to provide you with promotional content and newsletters, to facilitate registration for and delivery of the Viant Services, or for billing purposes. By voluntarily providing us with personal information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Policy.  B. Information We Collect Automatically  The Viant Services collect information about your device and the ads that we deliver onto your device. This information, which is collected passively using various technologies, may come from such sources as your web browser or the apps that you use. We also obtain the precise geolocation (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates) of your device and may use that information to assist our Clients with targeting ads tailored to your interests.  We also combine the information collected across multiple sites and mobile apps in order to create interest segments that help us target future advertisements based upon those inferred interests. This combined information may also include whether you engaged with specific content or ads; and whether you went on to visit an advertiser’s website, downloaded an advertiser’s app, purchased a product or service advertised, or took other actions. This practice is sometimes referred to as behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising.  We use this information as part of the Viant Services to perform a variety of tasks, such as limiting the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same User (frequency capping), providing an advertisement to only certain types of Users, or providing a report to a client on the number of its advertisements that were clicked. We share this information with Clients, Ad Partners, vendors, and other companies that we conduct business with as permitted by law.  Viant US LLC is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising by respecting the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising. The DAA tool is located at https://optout.aboutads.info . Viant US LLC (however, not Adelphic LLC) is also a member of Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and respects NAI’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising. The NAI tool is located at https://optout.networkadvertising.org . These tools enable you to opt out from receiving interest-based advertising from many of our Clients and Ad Partners.  We offer an “opt-out cookie” to block the placement of Viant’s behavioral advertising cookies on your system for two years from the time you opt out. When we detect our opt-out cookie on your browser, we do not serve you with interest-based advertising on the browser or device from which you have opted-out, or on the browsers or devices that we believe are linked to your opted-out browser or device. However, if you delete your cookies or begin using a new browser or device, you will need to opt out again. Browser settings that block all cookies may prevent the opt-out from operating correctly and certain privacy software may delete the opt-out cookie or cause it to function incorrectly. Furthermore, the opt-out cookie is not effective on devices that do not accept or otherwise support cookies, such as iOS based mobile devices, internet connected televisions and other non-cookie based connected devices and applications.  You may install our opt-out cookie by clicking the button below:     When you opt-out of interest-based advertising through the Viant Services (as described above), we stop sharing your information with our Clients and Ad Partners. That does not mean you will no longer receive advertising on the internet. However, it does mean that the display advertising you see will not be behaviorally targeted by us to your interests or preferences, so long as the opt-out cookie remains in place. Further, except for the specific restrictions noted above, our opt-out cookies do not otherwise prevent us from continuing to collect, maintain or use information as described herein, including for non-personalized advertising purposes (such as ad delivery and reporting) on your opted-out browser or device or on linked browsers and devices.  Cookies and other Web Technologies  In operating the Viant Services and Site, we use a technology called “cookies,” which are small text files that our Site serves to your browser when you access the Site or that some of our Clients and Ad Partners serve to your browser when you engage with them. Our cookies and other tracking mechanisms collect and store audience segments, help provide additional functionality to the Viant Services and Site and help us analyze usage more accurately.  Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. We do not currently support the Do Not Track browser option.  We also use an advertising identifier created by your mobile operating system to store information on our servers and later retrieve it to provide the Viant Services. The Android Advertising ID and Apple iOS’ IDFA are examples of advertising identifiers. For more information about advertising identifiers, please check the settings of your mobile device.  You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here .  Log Data  We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, which we refer to as “Log Data.” For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications, we may receive information about you. Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We use Log Data to operate our Services and optimize the performance of our Services.  C. Information We Collect about you from Our Clients, Affiliates and Ad Partners  Our Clients, Ad Partners, and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, IP address , device type, operating system, hashed email address, or hashed mobile ID (e.g., Apple IDFA or Android advertising ID), as well as location-based data such as Wi-Fi, cell tower, GPS or diagnostic location information, contextual information, and demographic information including age, gender and zip code.  Information we obtain from these third parties (including our affiliates) about you may be appended to information that we otherwise have about you for the purposes of targeting advertisements. For example, we match hashed versions of mobile IDs to data that we have de-identified (made pseudonymous) about you that resides in our platform in order to target advertising to you based on your device activity, inferred interests and location information.  We use your appended data to create interest based segments, including non-sensitive health and financial related interest-based segments as part of our services, including general interest-based segments such as “Health::Medical Centers” and “Finance::Insurance,” and custom interest-based segments such as “Health::Dieting::Acai Berry” and “Health::Contact Lens.” You may click here for a list of our general health and financial related interest-based segments . We do not use interest-based segments to determine credit worthiness or for insurance underwriting or employment eligibility purposes.  In the process of serving an advertisement to a device, we, or our partners, may decide to serve an ad based on one or more audience segments associated with that device, and the audience segment we believe may be associated with that device. Where Viant is able to use this and other information to infer that one browser or device likely belongs to the same User or household, the Viant Services may consider those browsers and devices “linked” for purposes of ad serving and interest-based advertising. This linking process is sometimes referred to as creating a device graph.  When you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with the Viant Services, they may collect information about your activities, subject to their own terms and privacy policies. Those companies’ use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, and the terms of this Policy do not apply. Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select Clients and Ad Partners, but those parties are not authorized to access Viant cookies.  3.

When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.  Embedded script  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about the way an advertisement displays on a website. The code is temporarily downloaded onto a user’s device from our web server or a third-party web server, is active only while you are connected to a particular website and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  Hashed  Hashed means de-identified. Technically, a hashing algorithm is a function that converts a data string into an alphanumeric string output of fixed length. When we use “hashed” in this privacy policy, we mean a de-identified version of the data that is hashed. For example, the hashed version of “example@example.com” is: 23463b99b62a72f26ed677cc556c44e8.  Interest-based segment  A user or group of users categorized on the basis of preferences or interests inferred from the data we collect and receive that are used as a basis for displaying advertisements and other content intended to be more relevant and useful to the user or users. Examples include “AUTO::Auto In-Market MASTER,” “TRAVEL::Travel In-Market MASTER” and “SPORTS::Sports Enthusiasts.”  IP address  Every computer connected to the internet is assigned a unique number known as an internet protocol (IP) address. Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country, and in many cases a more precise location, from which a computer is connecting to the internet.  Non-personal information  All forms of information other than personal information. This includes, for example, performance statistics, certain demographic information, and other similar data, whether collected by us or received from affiliates or third parties.  Personal information  Includes other similar terms under applicable privacy laws and includes any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated, or reasonably linked or linkable with an individual, device, or household.  Pixel  A pixel, also known as a pixel tag or web beacon, is a small snippet of code embedded in a website. Pixels allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. Pixels can be used count site visitations and conversions, gather broad-based user interest data, transmit to and receive information from third parties, deliver, read and write to cookies and for other purposes connected to the provision of advertising, analytics or other services.  Server logs  Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.  Unique identifier  A unique identifier is a string of characters that is used to recognize a user’s device, browser or other platform. Unique identifiers may be used in conjunction with or separate from cookies, including on platforms (e.g., certain mobile devices) where cookie technology is not available.  User panel  Panel of internet users that agree to anonymous recording of their ad exposure activity as they browse the web and are exposed to video and display advertisements in exchange for free software and services such as browser toolbars, games, and applications that provide information services such as weather, travel, news.
