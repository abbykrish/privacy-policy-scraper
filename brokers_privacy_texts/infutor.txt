Any personal information entered through our privacy portal is only used for the purpose of identifying the Consumer in our files, expressly for the Consumer’s purposes of Opt-Out and Privacy Protection. Entered information will NOT be used for any other purpose, including marketing, resale, or any other business usage.   1. Introduction to Infutor’s Services  Infutor and its various affiliates and subsidiaries provide to clients a wide variety of data products and services; help our clients (and their clients) to provide more targeted, efficient and relevant marketing and communications, and to understand their consumers better. Our clients may advertise to and communicate with their own customers through various media channels, like direct mail, email, display ads or even TV or radio ads. Many of these services are described in greater detail on our website, Infutor.com  Most of the information that we collect is not collected on this website, but rather from data suppliers and partners, our clients and their own data services partners. We thus provide this Privacy Policy as a service to consumers, potential clients and others who want to learn more about the data we work with in providing our services.  If you are a consumer specifically interested in your personal data as managed by Infutor, please refer to the following   Section 2, Consumer Privacy   If you are a consumer who resides in the state of California, or otherwise feels that you are covered by the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), in addition to Section 2, please also refer to the following   Section 3, California Consumer Privacy under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)   If you represent a business, and/or are specifically interested in the information that we collect for business purposes, please refer to the following Sections:   Section 4 (The Types of Data We Use and Obtain)  Section 5 (Our Services, and How We Use Information)  Section 6 (The Information Collected On Our Website For Business Purposes)  Section 7 (How We Work with and Share Data with Third Parties)  Section 8 (Cookies, Web Pixels, and Similar Technologies)  Section 9 (Your Marketing and Privacy Choices)     2. Consumer Privacy  Infutor obtains all Consumer information from permissible and legal sources. Infutor fully complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations as related to Consumer Privacy and Personal Information protection.  This includes the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  Infutor encourages Consumers to visit our website to learn about Data Privacy and understand the Consumer Opt-Out process. Further sections of this Policy will describe how Infutor’s website collects information for business purposes from visitors with a business interest. Consumers accessing Infutor’s website specifically for Privacy and Opt-Out purposes are NOT subject to any website data capture processes, including those described in Section 5 of this policy.   Consumer Opt Out of Infutor’s Database. You may click here to access the process to opt out of Infutor’s database. If you do so, please be prepared to include the following information: (a) first and last name, and (b) current address, (c) date of birth, and (d) your Social Security Number. You may also provide further information, including previous addresses, which may allow for a more complete information identification process. If you decide to opt out in this way, we will stop providing your data to help our customers send or tailor ads and content to you, including through email, direct mail or online display marketing. Doing so will not opt you out of our Clients’ databases, only data in Infutor’s own database – so other companies that we work with may still send ads, offers and content to you. While they may no longer be receiving your information from Infutor, our Clients may still be receiving your information from other sources. We may also retain certain information for products that involve risk, compliance or anti-fraud measures as permissibly allowed by law.     3. California Consumer Privacy under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)  In addition to the Consumer Privacy language in the above Section 2 , the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires businesses, including Infutor, to provide specific services and information for California consumers. These include:  A California Consumer has the right to request a disclosure of the personal information a business collects, uses, discloses, and sells. Infutor is considered a Data Broker as defined by CCPA. The data we collect and manage is described in Section 4 (The Types of Data That We Obtain and Use) of this Policy. Note that Infutor does NOT obtain or manage any information related to minors under the age of 18 years.  The business (Infutor) has the right and obligation to verify the identity of the Consumer requesting services related to CCPA. In order for Infutor to properly verify the Consumer’s identity prior to any information disclosure, Infutor will require, at a minimum, the Consumer’s full name, address, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, and valid email address. For the purposes of fraud prevention and other misuse, if a Consumer can not be reasonably verified, the services available under CCPA can not be rendered.  A California Consumer, upon proper verification of identity, also has the right to request that the Consumer’s personal information be deleted from all files that are used for commercial or business purposes. In the case of Infutor, this data deletion process has the same effect, and should be considered the same as an “Opt-Out” (as described in Section 2 ).  A California Consumer may click here to access the CCPA Disclosure and Opt-Out processes.    4. The Types of Data That We Obtain and Use  Infutor receives information from and handles information on behalf of a wide variety of consumer-facing companies, applications and services, “B2B” companies and services, and data compilers and suppliers. We sometimes receive information through public sources, such as census data, court or county clerk, property or legal records and other public records. This information (the “Information”) may include:   Identifying information such as first/last name, postal address, email address, and telephone number;  Information derived online, such as IP addresses, from which we may infer geographic location;  Telephone number;  Information about transactions or activities people have engaged in, like (simply for example) purchasing a home, registering a boat, joining a cycling club, or graduating from a nursing school;  We also sometimes collect or work with other companies that collect (in addition to IP addresses) anonymous or pseudonymous identifiers such as cookie identifiers or mobile identifiers. We also sometimes work with other companies that may combine various information they receive from us (which they may de-identify or obfuscate) with cookie identifiers or mobile identifiers, such as device-based IDFAs and Android Ad IDs, including to better target advertising and content.  Infutor DOES NOT acquire, manage, or resell any information related to minors under the age of 18 years.     5. Our Services, and How We Use Information  We use and make available Information for various purposes. For instance, we may use this Information for the following purposes:   We help clients and companies that provide services to our or their clients (all referred to as “Clients”) to deliver, target and optimize direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing. We may do this simply by providing Clients with Information, or we may provide additional operational services;  We may help Clients measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns (online and offline), such as by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases;  We create and share various data and identity models that help Clients to match common identities across different channels, such as (simply for illustration purposes) when a company wants to use its email list to market to those same customers through display channels, or when a company wants to use its customer list to send emails to those customers;  We sometimes create sets of consumer attributes – categories of personal interests that are grouped together based on common interests or preferences (“Data Segments”). These Data Segments may be associated with a person, household, or when used online, a unique online identifier, and may categorize a household (for instance) as enjoying movies, living in an affluent neighborhood, or being a member of a certain profession. Marketers may use these Data Segments to tailor more relevant ads and offers to groups of users, or to learn more about their own customers and improve their own databases.  We provide other data services, such as (but not limited to) verification, record look-ups, anti-fraud services, B2B records and services, and other analytics and database tools.   Sometimes, we may use Information and Data Segments to help Clients (including other data platforms) perform “cross-channel” marketing – analyzing, locating and creating potential marketing “audiences” through multiple channels, e.g., web and mobile, or TV/radio.  We sometimes work with online advertising platforms (or mobile or cable TV platforms) that may de-identify Information in order to market or help customers market to consumers. These marketing applications use cookies and similar technologies, often associated with unique online identifiers. If we ever interact with consumers (for business purposes) online, such as through a website or online ad or an email, we may employ cookies and similar technologies, which also may contain unique online identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please go to the below section titled Cookies, Web Pixels and Similar Technologies , and to opt out of the use of these technologies by many marketing applications that employ them for third party behavioral tracking and similar types of ad targeting, please go to the below section titled Your Marketing and Privacy Choices .  The above is not necessarily an exclusive description of the ways we may use Information or offer our services. (You may learn more about our products and services by reviewing descriptions of our services on our website.) However, we strive to use data responsible and to work with legal and responsible marketers, and to help marketers create and deliver marketing that is relevant and informative.    6.

How We Work With And Share Data With Third Parties  Infutor may share data it has, including Information and Data Segments, as follows:   Agents and Service Providers: We may share data, including the Information and Data Segments, with agents, business partners and service providers who work on our behalf, or to help us provide services requested by Clients (or their service providers), including to perform any of the services described in this Privacy Policy. We may do so, for instance, to help send or target advertising on behalf of our clients (or ourselves), for analytical purposes, to measure campaigns, bill or perform services for Clients, or inform future campaigns. We may do so to facilitate the sending of display media, email, or other requested services.  Partners: We may share data, including the Information and Data Segments, with business and data partners or with Clients, to help provide more tailored advertising and for analytical purposes.  Corporate transfers: If Infutor or its significant assets are purchased by another entity, our data will likely be transferred to that entity, including for due diligence prior to any such potential purchase.  Affiliates, Parents and Subsidiaries: We may share some or all of the data in our possession with affiliated or subsidiary companies.  As Required by Law or to Protect Any Party: Infutor may disclose data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwise defend the rights, property or safety of Infutor, a Client or any other party.  Data We Collect on Our Website. We use data that you provide to us on our website to market, we may use this data for our business purposes. For instance, if you provide us with your name and email address, we may put your into our proprietary database and send you newsletters about our company, our services, and events.     8. Cookies, Web Pixels, and Similar Technologies  This section provides more information about cookies and similar technologies that we, our Clients and our business partners may use, and how they work.   Cookies. Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on users’ own computers. For instance, cookies can be used to store sign-in credentials so that you don’t have to enter them each time you return to a website, or to store other information to make web viewing more customized or efficient upon future visits. Cookies also may store a unique identifier tied to your computer so that web services and content and advertising networks can recognize you across visits to different websites. You can configure your internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse all or certain cookies completely. However, this may interfere with the functionality of your web browsing or your ability to fully use many websites.  Pixels or web beacons. Pixels or web beacons may also communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Pixels can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed.   We sometimes work with third parties to enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of retargeting and tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies). These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration period. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of anonymous or de-identified information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.  We also may place cookies when you open an email that we send, in order to help understand how email recipients respond to email campaigns, or to learn more (or help our clients learn more) about those recipients.  When you visit our website, we (or a partner we work with) may place cookies to help us target or re-target marketing to you when you visit other websites or web or mobile applications – for instance, to tell you about our services, events and other information about our company.  Please note that our business partners may also use cookies and pixels, which we have no control over. For instance, we sometimes provide our or our clients proprietary data lists to companies that de-identify Information (such as email addresses) and Data Segments and associate them with online cookies or similar technologies (such as mobile identifiers). Some of these partners may also associate online cookies with mobile identifiers (or other device identifiers) in order to associate use identities across browsers, devices, or technologies.    9. Your Marketing and Privacy Choices   Opting Out of Online Targeting. If you wish to opt out of other third party ad platforms and ad networks (including ones we work with and may have transferred data to in the past), we recommend visiting the opt-out pages offered by the Network Advertising Initiative and the DAA’s AboutAds program. Opting out through the above methods will cause one or more opt-out cookies to be set on your browser or device, to indicate that you have opted out. Opting out in this way won’t prevent you from seeing ads: but it will in many cases lead the companies listed to stop customizing ads based on inferences they have made about you or your interests. Also note that these “opt-outs” are browser-specific, so opting out on one browser will not affect a second browser or device that you use. Thus, if you buy a new device, change browsers or clear all cookies, you’ll need to perform this opt-out task again.  Unsubscribing from Our Emails. When we send an email to you (whether on our behalf or on behalf of a Client), we will provide a way for you to opt out of receiving similar emails in the future. Usually, this appears as an “unsubscribe” or “opt out” link in the footer of the email.     10.
