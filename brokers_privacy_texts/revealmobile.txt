If you want to see the data we have stored for your device, email optout@revealmobile.com along with your IDFA and/or AdID.  We’ll then ask for verification of your identity, and then provide you the data, if any, we have stored about your device, and allow you to rectify any errors in any personal data as permitted by applicable law.
