We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of an offer or promotion.    > How the Clearinghouse Uses Your Personally Identifiable Information  Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)  FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all Participating Institutions that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Although FERPA does not directly apply to private organizations, unless they receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education, FERPA regulates what data Participating Institutions can share with the Clearinghouse, and what redisclosures of that data the Clearinghouse can make. The Clearinghouse commits to following FERPA regulations as a School Official (as that term is defined by FERPA) as appointed by Participating Institutions. This section introduces some terms used in FERPA to discuss education records, as well as how the Clearinghouse complies with FERPA in its use of education records.  FERPA Permissible Uses   The Clearinghouse only discloses education records under the following limited FERPA permissible uses:   Consent: An education record may be disclosed to a third party if a valid consent from the student has been obtained in writing (may be electronic), signed and dated, specifying the records that may be disclosed, stating the purpose of disclosure, and identifying the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be  School Official: Participating Institutions may disclose education records to School Officials, provided there is a legitimate educational interest served by the disclosure.  State and Local Educational Authorities: An education record may be disclosed without consent to an authorized representative of state and local education authorities for audit and evaluation purposes.  Financial Aid: An education record may be disclosed in connection with a student’s application for, or receipt of, financial aid.  Research: An education record may be disclosed to an organization conducting a study for or on behalf of an educational institution, in order to develop, validate, or administer predictive tests; administer student aid programs; or improve instruction.  Directory Information: Directory information may be disclosed without consent, as it consists of information that is generally considered not to be harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.   Student Rights Under FERPA  Although FERPA allows for disclosure of education records without student consent in certain circumstances, eligible students (students who are over the age of 18 or attend postsecondary school) and parents of non‐eligible students still have the following rights:   inspect and review the student’s education records maintained by the school  request that a school amend the student’s education records  control who has access to the student’s records   The first two rights concern how the education records are collected and maintained by a student’s institution. If you believe there is an error in your records or they are incomplete, you must contact your institution directly to correct that error. The Clearinghouse may only amend a record at the request and direction of a Participating Institution. You may also inspect and review the education records kept by your institution. You can find more information on how to control who has access to your education record through administering directory information blocks and your rights as a student under FERPA on the U.S. Department of Education’s website: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/students.html  Website Access Intended for Unites States Use Only  The Clearinghouse’s Websites and Services are intended for exclusive use within the United States (U.S.) and its territories. Locations outside of the U.S. and its territories may have regulatory requirements that differ from the U.S. and, therefore, this information may be inappropriate for use outside the U.S. Therefore, the Clearinghouse makes no representation that the information on our Websites is appropriate or available for use in non-U.S. locations.  European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)  The European Union GDPR is a regulation that protects the privacy and security of personal data collected from individuals within the territory of the European Union (“EU data subjects”). It applies to organizations established outside of the EU if they:   process the personal data of EU data subjects when offering them goods or services; or  monitor the behavior of EU data subjects.   The Clearinghouse neither offers goods or services to EU data subjects nor monitors their behavior. Therefore, the GDPR does not directly apply to the Clearinghouse. However, the Clearinghouse works with organizations, including certain Participating Institutions, that collect or process personal data of EU data subjects, making them subject to the GDPR.  At the request of organizations who provide personal data collected from EU data subjects to the Clearinghouse for processing (such organizations hereinafter referred to as “Controller organizations”), the Clearinghouse enters into a Data Processing Addendum with Controller organizations whereby the Clearinghouse as a processor agrees to assist these organizations with the fulfillment of their obligations as set out in the GDPR. The Clearinghouse also agrees to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In case of a personal data breach, the Clearinghouse will notify the Controller organization(s) without undue delay upon becoming aware of the personal data breach. In all such instances, the Clearinghouse is processing the personal data of EU data subjects solely on behalf of and at the direction of the Controller organizations that provide personal data to the Clearinghouse for processing.  Providing Clearinghouse Services  Financial Aid Services:  As an agent of Participating Institutions, the Clearinghouse partners with Participating Institutions for the purpose of reporting enrollment statuses of students to various lenders, servicers, guaranty agencies, and the U.S. Department of Education (collectively “Lenders”). The Clearinghouse periodically receives enrollment files containing all enrolled students from Participating Institutions, which it incorporates into its nationwide central repository of enrollment information. Lenders submit listings of their financial aid recipients to the Clearinghouse and the Clearinghouse advises the Lenders on which financial aid recipients are currently enrolled in Participating Institutions. The regularity and content of this process conform to applicable federal and guaranty agency regulations. This service benefits both the Participating Institutions and their students. Under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, students receiving federal student loans are entitled to a deferment of their repayment obligation while they are enrolled in an institution of higher education, and thus institutions are required to report student enrollment information to these entities. By utilizing the Clearinghouse’s enrollment reporting service, institutional reporting burdens are alleviated, and students are able to receive the loan deferment benefit afforded to them by law.  Research:  In providing its enrollment reporting and verification services to Participating Institutions, the Clearinghouse collects enrollment and degree data on students enrolled in Participating Institutions. The Clearinghouse’s coverage of this data, which includes the public, private nonprofit, and private for‐profit sectors, gives the Clearinghouse the unique capability to work with Participating Institutions, states, districts, high schools, and educational organizations to better inform practitioners about student educational pathways. The Clearinghouse harnesses this capability through its StudentTracker ® services, as well as its research arm, the Research Center.   StudentTracker ® : Participating Institutions have appointed the Clearinghouse as their agent to respond to the requests of authorized educational institutions, organizations, and agencies (“Authorized Requesting Entities”) for information on the postsecondary enrollment of, and credentials earned by, their current and former students, under the directory information, audit and evaluation, and/or studies exceptions to FERPA, as applicable. These Authorized Requesting Entities use this information for educational and related purposes, including the following:  Postsecondary institutions can determine whether, and at what institutions, former students pursued further postsecondary education, providing insight into student pathways and success for use in institutional improvement.  Postsecondary institutions can identify the institution(s) eventually attended by those applicants who declined their offer of admission, providing assistance with student recruitment efforts.  Secondary schools, school districts, and state K‐12 educational authorities can determine the postsecondary enrollment and credential attainment of their students, providing insights they can use to improve their college preparation efforts.  Secondary schools, school districts, and state K‐12 education authorities can use this information in connection with an audit or evaluation of federal or state-supported education programs or for conducting studies to improve instruction.  Programs, like TRIO and GEAR UP, which provide support to disadvantaged students to enable their educational success, can better measure their effectiveness by obtaining enrollment and credential attainment data on program participants.  Authorized researchers may obtain postsecondary enrollment and degree attainment data to conduct research aimed at improving the provision of education to students or administering student aid programs.    Additional Information Regarding StudentTracker ® for High Schools : Through the Clearinghouse’s StudentTracker ® for High Schools Service, participating high schools, school districts, state and local educational agencies and authorities (“STHS Participants”) provide the Clearinghouse with data on their graduates, including PII, and the Clearinghouse returns reports to the STHS Participants on the postsecondary enrollment and degrees of those Specifically, STHS Participants provide the Clearinghouse with the following types of education records as part of the service, for the following purposes:  PII (name, date of birth) and information on the graduates’ high school and graduation date, required for the purpose of matching the graduates of the STHS Participant with the postsecondary records held by the Clearinghouse.  PII (name, date of birth) and information on the graduates’ high school and graduation date, which STHS Participants are required to report as part of the service, and which is used for the purpose of providing reports back to the STHS Participant on the postsecondary enrollment and degrees of its graduates. Graduates’ program codes are provided for this purpose at the option of the STHS Participant.  Student ID number may be provided at the option of the STHS Participant, for the administrative convenience of the STHS Participant, and is included in the reports sent back by the Clearinghouse to the STHS Participant.  While Social Security Number is not required in the STHS service, some STHS Participants submit it as an identifier. If available, SSN is returned with the students’ postsecondary enrollment and degree information. SSN is not used in the matching process within STHS.  Assessment results, demographic data, and curriculum information, which may be provided at the option of the STHS Participant, for the purpose of providing richer aggregate reporting back to the STHS Participant.  For the purpose of producing aggregate research: high school graduation date (required for the service) and ethnicity (at the STHS Participant’s option).  STHS Participants also are required to provide, and may sort their submission by, the type of diploma earned by the student. This data element serves to confirm students as graduates and may be used in the future for research purposes.   The Clearinghouse does not disclose student PII provided through this service to third parties, except as necessary for the maintenance of the service or as required by law. The Clearinghouse contractually restricts third parties involved in the maintenance of the service from using the data in any unauthorized way, trains them on Clearinghouse privacy and security requirements, and monitors their access to PII.  The Clearinghouse uses these education records to report data in a de‐identified, aggregated form for authorized research purposes. The Clearinghouse works with STHS Participants to support mutual compliance with FERPA. A parent, legal guardian, or eligible student may exercise their right to review and inspect education records held by the Clearinghouse as agent for STHS Participants by contacting the STHS Participant. The STHS Participant may then contact its designated account representative at the Clearinghouse for support.  If we make material changes in the manner in which we process PII in our STHS service that reduce the privacy protections applicable to such PII, we will notify the STHS Participant on whose behalf we are performing the STHS service at least thirty (30) days prior to the date the change becomes effective.  We will provide notification through our Website of other changes in the way we process PII in our STHS service.   Research Center : Through aggregated longitudinal data outcomes reporting, the Research Center facilitates better educational policy decisions leading to improved student outcomes. The Clearinghouse periodically produces several aggregate reports on student enrollment, movement, and other important student Learn more at: https://nscresearchcenter.org/ .   Verifications:  The Clearinghouse uses the enrollment information it receives from Participating Institutions for the Financial Aid‐ Related Services outlined above, as well as additional degree information it receives from Participating Institutions, to provide verification services to eligible requestors (“Requestors”). When you apply for a product, service, or employment that depends on your enrollment or graduation status, the provider of that product, service, or employment may contact the Clearinghouse to verify the enrollment, degree, or professional certification information you have provided in your application. On behalf of Participating Institutions, we will compare the information provided by the Requestor with the education record information we received from your Participating Institution in order to verify the information you provided in your application, which can assist the Requestor in determining your eligibility for the product, service, or employment.  We never release any information about you for the purpose of targeted advertising.  Transcripts:  The Clearinghouse delivers student transcripts to third parties only with a student’s consent or, if another valid FERPA exception applies, at the direction of the Participating Institution. Your institution electronically sends the Clearinghouse your transcript, which we securely transmit to the recipient(s) you have requested (we employ electronic and print‐to‐mail transmission systems from which you may select), such as another educational institution or a prospective employer. As part of the electronic transcript delivery methods offered by the Clearinghouse, a transcript may be temporarily maintained by us until delivered and accessed by the recipient of the transcript order.  If we make material changes in the manner in which we process high school transcripts that reduce the privacy protections applicable to such transcripts, we will notify the educational institution or agency on whose behalf we are delivering such transcripts at least thirty (30) days prior to the date the change becomes effective.  We will provide notification through our Website of other changes in the way we process high school transcripts.  Course Exchange:  The Clearinghouse facilitates the awarding of degrees and certificates between Participating Institutions by transmitting course data through Reverse Transfer and other course exchange programs. Reverse Transfer allows students who transfer from a two‐year institution to a four‐year institution without first obtaining an Associate’s Degree to still receive that degree from the two‐year institution when they have completed the requisite courses to qualify. This Reverse Transfer is done with student consent, collected by the student’s four‐year institution.  Request for Correction or Deletion by Participating Institutions and STHS Participants  Participating Institutions and STHS Participants that send the Clearinghouse student data in order to receive Clearinghouse services may request the correction or deletion of such data by contacting their Clearinghouse contact, by sending an email to privacy@studentclearinghouse.org , or calling the Clearinghouse at (703) 742-4200.
