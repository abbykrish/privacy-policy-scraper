It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.  We offer a wide range of Services to employers, businesses, and individuals, including background check and identity verification services. For example, we provide:   Criminal record, education, motor vehicle record, and credit screening services to employers for current and prospective employee background checks.  Services for individuals to run employment background checks on themselves.  Non-employment background checks and identity verification services for businesses that want to screen current or prospective users.

This policy does not cover data collected by or through third-party websites or services.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE INFLECTION SERVICES OR VISIT INFLECTION WEBSITES.           Our Data Collection Practices          Information We Collect  In order to provide the Services, we collect personal information directly from our users, from our customers as part of providing our Services, from visitors to our Services, and from public records.           Collection Directly from Our Users  We collect information about users who create accounts with us:   Creating an account. If you create an account, we ask you to provide some basic registration information such as your name and email address. If you're registering on behalf of a company, we may also ask you to provide some details about that company as well.  Making a purchase. If you choose to make a purchase from us, we ask you to provide billing details such as credit card or ACH information.  Commenting on a report. If you choose to add annotations to your personal background report, your comment may be made available to anyone that you authorize to receive a copy of that report. When you write your comment, you can select whether you’d like for your comment to be visible only to a particular employer or to all future employers who view your report.  Contacting us. If you contact our customer service team, we will collect your contact information, such as phone number or email address, as well as the contents of your communication. We may also ask for additional information to help us better assist you, such as technical information about your browser or information about your account with us.            Collection When We Provide Services to Our Business Customers  We may need to collect personal information from you in order to provide Services to our business customers, which may include employers and other companies or organizations that purchase our Services. For example, if you are the subject of a background check, or if a business customer requests that you verify your identity with us, we may collect some identifying information about you to provide the Services to our business customers.   Authorizing a background check. When you authorize one of our business customers to run a background check on you, we ask for your legal name, date of birth, and other identifying details such as your Social Security number, residential address, or past employment or educational history (depending on the type of background check requested). If the background check is authorized electronically, we also collect your email address and/or phone number.  Verifying your identity. We may collect personal information from you so that we can confirm that you are who you say you are. This personal information could include your legal name, address, phone number, email address, Social Security number, financial or utility account information, or a government-issued photo ID document.            Collection from Third Party Sources  If you authorize one of our business customers to run a background check on you, we'll collect public records and other information from reliable third-party sources to assemble the report.
