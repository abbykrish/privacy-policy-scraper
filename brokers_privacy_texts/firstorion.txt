Privacy Policy US  First Orion’s Privacy Policy Effective 04/24/2020 First Orion Corp is a business dedicated to using technology and data to give consumers tools to recognize and manage calls they receive and to help businesses reach the right people in a compliant manner.  Our mission is to provide transparency and control in communication that empowers people to trust their phones again. This Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of personal information and the technologies used by First Orion in the U.S. and Canada for all First Orion’s products and services, our free or subscription-based Apps (including PrivacyStar TM ), and our website. Our products and services include various features and functionality to tell you who is calling and why, identify and block businesses who are likely scammers, do reverse telephone number lookups, file complaints and report call violations to the proper authorities, and have enhanced information displayed on your device about who is calling you and why.  In addition, our Call Knowledge Suite helps companies verify to whom the phone number belongs, what type of line it is (wireless, landline or other), and whether a number is in service. Your Rights as a Consumer First Orion takes the privacy of personal information about individuals seriously.  Under various federal and state laws, you have certain rights related to how your personal information is collected, used, disclosed, and sold.  First Orion extends these privacy rights to anyone who is a resident of the United States or Canada.  In addition, these rights apply differently to each line of business as described below. A general description of your rights is provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. First Orion‘s Call Knowledge Suite First Orion’s Call Knowledge Suite helps businesses reach the right people and the right companies in a compliant manner with several products and services that provide information our clients need to comply with various telecommunication laws and regulations. Our Call Knowledge Suite collects and sells information about a phone number (both consumer and business lines), including names and addresses, the status of the phone number (active or inactive), and other information about the line.  This information is collected by First Orion from third parties, both carriers and data brokers, from our own research activities, and from publicly available government records. Our clients, businesses, and data resellers use this information to verify contact numbers, know the type of line (landline or cell) so they can comply with various laws and regulations, and know whether a line is active or inactive so they won’t waste money trying to call it.  In addition, we provide information when phone lines are ported from one carrier to another.  We also identify businesses who our analytics show are likely scammers. Finally, we use this information internally to improve the functionality of our Apps and services. You may opt-out of the sale of your personal information in our Call Knowledge products by going to privacy.firstorion.com . All personal information relative to our Call Knowledge Suite is stored in the U.S. and retained until the information is no longer accurate. First Orion’s Call Enhancement Suite (Engage ® and Inform TM Services) First Orion’s Call Enhancement Suite of services provides companies who call you the ability to display enriched, branded, personalized information so you know more about who is calling and why they are calling  so you are comfortable answering the call. Our Inform TM service allows a business who is calling you to control the caller ID display on your phone instead of the carrier controlling the display.  This service is provided through carriers who are clients of First Orion. Our Engage ® service allows a richer display of information that is not limited to the caller ID field. This service is provided through our stand-alone Engage ® App, or as a feature of other Apps you may download. You can find our Engage® App in the Google Play Store for Android devices or the App Store for iPhones. When you download the App, it collects identifying information in the form of your phone number and uses it initially for identity validation purposes.  We also use your phone number and other specifications about your device so we know where to deliver the enhanced information about the caller and to properly deliver the message in a compatible format. For the App to function, you will need to allow it to access your contacts so the Engage ® delivery service can dynamically create a contact for incoming calls that display the enhanced information. We do NOT export any information from your contacts for any purpose outside of the App. Once the enhanced call is delivered to your phone, the contact is automatically deleted. All personal information relative to our Call Enhancement Suite is stored in the U.S. and retained until it is no longer needed by our clients. We do not sell your personal information in our Call Enhancement Suite of services. First Orion’s Call Protection Suite First Orion’s Call Protection Suite of services provides business labels such as “Scam Likely” and “Telemarketer” to identify likely scammers and other types of callers and help you to not become a victim of phone fraud or to be bothered by unwanted calls. In addition, the services offer various other features and functionality for you to block unwanted, private, or unknown calls, do reverse telephone number lookups, file complaints, and report call violations to the proper authorities. You can take advantage of First Orion’s Call Protection Suite of services in several ways.  You can download the free or paid First Orion PrivacyStar TM App or you can access these features through your telecommunication carrier if they are a First Orion client. You can find our PrivacyStar TM App in the Google Play Store for Android devices or the App Store for iPhones. Your phone number will be used for identity validation purposes and to know whom to bill for fee-based services as well as to improve the functionality of our Apps and carrier services. To provide this service, First Orion’s data scientists analyze information from your carrier and the App about the calls you receive and the actions you take (such as blocking a call or reporting a problem).  We also collect and analyze identifying information (name, address, and phone number) about businesses from third parties, including carriers and data brokers, and publicly available government records to accurately identify business lines. When you download the App, you will need to agree to several questions so that it functions properly.  The questions may vary depending on whether you are on an Android or iOS device since these operating systems function differently. – Allow First Orion to make and manage phone calls? This allows the App to launch a call from your detail screen when you touch the phone icon and to perform all the other call management activities provided in the App such as identifying unknown callers, blocking calls, filing complaints, and receiving enhanced caller information about who is calling and why. – Allow First Orion to access your contacts? We want to assure any incoming call from a number already in your contacts displays the name from your contacts on your device. We do NOT export outside the App any information from your contacts for any purpose. – Allow First Orion to send and view SMS messages? This allows the App to streamline the verification process which sends an SMS message when you first launch the App and to block SMS messages from the same numbers used to make scam calls. The App does not do anything else with SMS messages. In the U.S. if you voluntarily choose to provide complaint information about calls you receive, this information will be provided to the appropriate government agencies including, but not limited to, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to aid in their enforcement activities.  We may also use complaint information to assist calling parties in understanding how individuals who are called view their calling practices and to better understand complaint and call block trends. First Orion does not sell any personal information collected in connection with our Call Protection services. All personal information relative to our Call Protection Suite is stored in the U.S. and retained for 12-18 months. First Orion’s Corporate Website First Orion has a corporate website that explains, among other things, our lines of business and provides a link to this privacy policy which explains your rights relative to each line of business, how to contact us, and a link ( Do Not Sell My Personal Information ) to opt-out of the sale of your personal information from our Call Knowledge Suite of products and services .
