(BIS) is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy covers BIS's web site, and BIS's policies for handling personal information provided to BIS over the Internet by the public www.bisi.com. This Policy also covers personal information provided by BIS's clients, and the applicants/employees who have given their written authorization for BIS's clients to conduct a background investigation on them, using BIS's online background screening system that is accessible only through an access-restricted portion of BIS's web site. BIS will collect, store, and use personally identifiable information only in compliance with applicable law.  Collection of Information. While browsing www.bisi.com, you do so anonymously. BIS collects personally identifiable information only if you choose to provide this information to us. In some instances, BIS may collect non-personal (e.g., aggregate or demographic) data through cookies. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of www.bisi.com. Please see further information below under "Cookies." The type of personal information we may collect about you through www.bisi.com includes, but is not limited to, the following (should you decide to provide such information to BIS): (a) contact and identifying information (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, phone and fax numbers, employer(s), job title) in connection with your expressed interest in receiving information about, or your registering for, BIS products, services, or newsletters; (b) your resume information and employment application information regarding BIS job openings; and (c) all other personal information that you may voluntarily provide to us in an online form or email. Access to certain BIS web pages and online services is not available to the general public and requires a login code with a BIS-provided username and password. Those web pages, and the information available from those pages, are made available only to clients of BIS. BIS collects only information that the user voluntarily shares with BIS. If you are using this web site to inquire into opening a background screening account with BIS, we only collect basic company demographics and contact information. This information is used for internal purposes, such as account establishment and customer service.  How Your Information is Used. When your personal data is collected on www.bisi.com, BIS will inform you at that time of the purpose for the collection. BIS will use your personal data only in the manner indicated when it is collected, unless you consent to a different use. If you have provided your personal data over this web site in connection with a background screen ordered by a BIS client, BIS may only use your personal data to perform a background screen for that client. BIS will not use your data to conduct a background screening investigation to produce a consumer report unless BIS's client provides an FCRA certification. In this certification, BIS's client certifies to BIS that it has a legally permissible purpose for ordering the background screen; and that it has, as required by applicable law, obtained your consent to conduct the background screen; and that it will follow proper Adverse Action procedures.  Information Sharing and Disclosure BIS does not sell any personal information to third parties. BIS won’t disclose your personal information to a third party unless while performing your background screen for BIS's client or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. BIS may disclose personal information as necessary in connection with any of the purposes for which we use personal information as described above in "How Your Information is Used." When BIS conducts a background screening on you, BIS may disclose information that you submit through this web site to the BIS client that requested a background screening investigation on you. As needed, BIS may also disclose your information to certain third parties to conduct the background investigation (such as courts, law enforcement agencies, prior employers, educational institutions, and/or other entities that may provide or verify information about you), as well as to third-party representatives authorized by BIS to assist in the background screening investigation. These third-party representatives include, but are not limited to, our platform provider who assists with hosting, web site support or technical assistance and court runners. BIS transfers to these parties only the information necessary to deliver to BIS the requested product or service. BIS forbids these parties from using that information for any other purpose. BIS requires that these parties maintain reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality and security of your information. BIS may also disclose personal information and any other pertinent information available to BIS for any of the following purposes: (i) investigate, prevent or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of BIS's terms of use; (ii) respond to or defend against subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; (iii) establish or exercise BIS's legal rights; or (iv) otherwise comply with applicable law. In the event of an acquisition, the information BIS collects may be one of the assets examined or transferred as part of the transaction. BIS will forbid another business to examine the information BIS has collected without a confidentiality agreement, and only to the extent permitted by law. BIS will not transfer the collected information unless the receiving party agrees to furnish privacy protections that are equal to, or exceeding, those established by this Privacy Policy.
