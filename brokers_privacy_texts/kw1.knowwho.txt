(“KnowWho”) provides a variety of helpful products and services that can be ordered online through its web site www.knowwho.com . Because the success of KnowWho is dependent on building and maintaining goodwill with our customers, we are committed to implementing measures designed to protect the privacy of those using and purchasing our products and services. Moreover, we see it as our responsibility to help set an example and establish the standards for privacy on the Internet.  Although KnowWho respects the privacy of all those who visit our web site and purchase and use our products and services, we do collect information from our customers. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with the KnowWho web site, and your registration for, purchase and use of KnowWho’s products and services. As explained more fully in this Privacy Policy, we do not release to third parties personally identifiable information about our customers.  Please note that KnowWho reviews its privacy practices from time to time, and that those practices are, therefore, subject to change. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. To contact KnowWho about privacy issues, to report a violation of our Privacy Policy or to raise any other issue, please e-mail us at info@knowwho.com .  THE INFORMATION WE GATHER  KnowWho gathers two types of information about users:  (1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to our web site, we may collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the web site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the logging of the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the KnowWho web site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.  We also use “temporary” or “session” cookies – that is, small text files temporarily placed on a user’s computer hard drive upon the occurrence of some event that is started by the user when visiting the KnowWho site – to help us determine the type of content and sites to which a visitor to the KnowWho site links, the length of time each visitor spends at any particular area of the KnowWho site and the type of KnowWho products or services visitors choose to use and purchase from the KnowWho site. Essentially, cookies are a visitor’s identification card for the KnowWho computers, or servers, that placed them there. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies allow KnowWho to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at KnowWho’s web site. Moreover, because we only use “temporary” or “session” cookies and not “permanent cookies,” (except where a user has specifically noted a desire to be logged in to My KnowWho permanently) when you choose to close your browser, our cookies automatically disappear, so we cannot identify visitors when they revisit the KnowWho site after closing their browser. Nevertheless, you should also be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser.  (2) Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the KnowWho web site – for example, when registering to become a KnowWho customer or to purchase KnowWho products or services – we require that you provide us with personally identifiable information (including, for example, first name, surname, street address, e-mail address, telephone number and, when applicable, credit card information).  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age) without obtaining parental consent. Before registering to purchase KnowWho products or services, we ask that children have their parents read our Privacy Policy. Before and during the registration or purchasing process, we encourage children to include a parent or guardian in the process.  HOW WE USE (AND DO NOT USE) THE INFORMATION WE GATHER  Please take some time to familiarize yourself how KnowWho uses and does not use the information that it gathers:  (1) Non-personally identifiable information: KnowWho uses non-personally identifiable information solely to manage the content of your shopping cart on the KnowWho site and to personalize and enhance your experience on the KnowWho site. We do not share any non-personally identifiable information with any third parties.  Please note that the KnowWho web site may contain links to other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by KnowWho. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites’ use of any information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected when visitors to the KnowWho web site click through links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.  (2) Personally identifiable information: KnowWho provides notice to potential KnowWho registrants or purchasers of KnowWho products and services that personally identifiable information will be collected during the registration or purchasing process. Such notice is provided simultaneously with your KnowWho registration or purchase of KnowWho products or services; moreover, this Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information is collected solely under the following circumstances: Except for your credit card information which is used solely to complete an ordering transaction of KnowWho products or services and then discarded, such personal identifiable information is stored only for future use by KnowWho and not for use by any third parties. None of your personally identifiable information is ever shared with any third party. Although you may not “opt out” of the registration or purchasing process if you wish to become a KnowWho customer or purchase products or services from KnowWho, you may choose to “opt out” of receiving KnowWho promotional materials. If you do not “opt out” of receiving such promotional materials, KnowWho reserves the right to solely use your personally identifiable registration or purchasing information (except your credit card information) for KnowWho’s internal promotional purposes. We will not release your credit card information (or any personally identifiable information for that matter) to any third party nor shall we store any of your credit card information after we have completed the transaction with you. If you decide that you would like to discontinue receiving promotional information from KnowWho, please contact us at webmaster@knowwho.com .  KnowWho limits its own e-mail solicitations to those customers who have not “opted out” of receiving such communications. The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the customer with a method of “opting out” of receiving future communications of a similar nature.  We reserve the right to release information contained within our access logs concerning any visitor or customer when that visitor or customer is in violation of our web site Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order, and to release such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required by law. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement individuals or entities for investigation or prosecution.  CHANGING OR DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION; BUSINESS TRANSFERS  If you would like to have your stored personally identifiable information corrected or removed from KnowWho’s database or records, or would like to have access to your stored personally identifiable information, please contact us at info@knowwho.com , and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that should you desire to have your personally identifiable information removed, there may be residual information that will remain within KnowWho’s databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, KnowWho reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or users of KnowWho.  In addition, we may sell or transfer assets or portions of our business as we continue to improve our product and service offerings. In such transactions, user or visitor information (whether non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) may constitute one of the transferred business assets.
