Who are we?  Factual helps companies and other organizations better understand and engage with consumers and markets by using location data. Factual’s services draw observations about individuals from location data collected from the individual’s device such as their tablet or smartphone. We refer to these individuals as “ Consumers “.  Factual’s customers (“ Customers “), such as brands, advertising agencies, and online ad platforms, may use this information for the purpose we describe below. For example, if location data suggests that a Consumer regularly visits golf courses, a Customer may decide to show golf-related advertisements to that Consumer  2. What information does Factual hold?  Factual’s data falls into two broad categories: Point of Interest Data (or POI Data) and Observation Data. Factual combines POI Data and Observation Data to provide its services. Factual holds detailed information related to businesses and other points of interest for example on restaurants, stores, hotels, doctors’ offices, airports, and monuments and includes location coordinates (e.g., the latitude-longitude coordinates of a local grocery store). We refer to this information as “ Point of Interest Data .”  Factual also processes information about Consumers, which is described in the table below. We refer to this information and the inferences that Factual draws from this information as “ Observation Data. “     Demographic information  Information that includes data about a Consumer such as age range, gender, and/or birth year.    Device information  Information about a device and apps which generally includes mobile advertising identifier, device type (e.g., tablet, smartphone, television), operating system (e.g., iOS, Android), app names and/or identifiers, IP address, network provider, mobile carrier, mobile browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome), timestamp, time zone, information about the speed, bearing, orientation, and altitude of a device, or other information about the device.    Geolocation data  Precise geolocation data from or about a device (e.g., latitude-longitude coordinates).    Exposure data  Information about the advertising and content that has been displayed on a particular device.    Cross-device data  Information about the possible relationships among different devices such as browsers, mobile devices, and televisions (outside the EEA*).    Other data  Information such as consumer products information, inferences drawn from other data described above, or information about events that were held at specific locations, that Factual has associated with a particular device (e.g., a device attended a Wimbledon match).     *In this privacy policy, we will use “ EEA ” to refer to the European Economic Area, the UK and Switzerland.  Observation Data does not include information that has been aggregated or deidentified (so that it does not identify a specific device).  3. How does Factual get this information?  Factual creates its POI Data using information from third party data contributors, Customers, and the open web.  Factual receives Observation Data from suppliers and sometimes from Customers.  Factual’s suppliers are third parties (e.g., third-party app publishers, data aggregators, ad tech platforms, etc.) who provide Observation Data to Factual for general use in our Services. Some suppliers use a Factual software development kit (SDK) to provide us with Observation Data.  In addition, some Customers provide Observation Data for Factual to use in providing Services solely to those Customers and their clients (e.g., an ad agency and its advertiser client), and not for use in Factual’s generally available services. For example, Customers may use a Factual pixel to provide Factual with exposure data.  4. How does Factual use this data in its services?  Factual uses POI Data and Observation Data to create and improve our services.     Category  Such data is used to:    POI Data    Give Customers a reliable set of business and other locations to use in their own services. E.g., a Customer may use POI Data to show points of interest on a map.  Enable Factual to determine the businesses and other locations that a device has visited.      Observation Data    Enable Customers to target advertising and personalize content and services based on inferred traits or preferences such as ‘luxury good shopper’. E.g., a jewelry store could use Factual’s services to send exclusive offers to luxury goods shoppers.  Help Customers evaluate customer preferences and behaviors.  Allow Customers to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. E.g., a car dealership could use our services to determine if its ad campaign persuaded Consumers to visit the dealership.  Provide Customers with insights and analysis of markets, Consumer behavior and business opportunities, and enable Customer to draw their own insights and analysis.  Give Customers a resource to design and improve other products and services.  Enrich Customer data assets.       5. Does Factual share Observation Data  Observation Data will be disclosed in the limited circumstances described below:     Categories of recipients  Purpose of sharing.    Customers  Factual will disclose Observation Data in order to provide its services to Customers.    Government, law enforcement, or regulatory bodies.  Factual will disclose Observation Data if it believes that such action is necessary to comply or assist with applicable laws or regulatory investigations, or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, warrant, or law enforcement request.    Factual’s service providers.  Factual shares Observation Data with service providers that help it provide or improve the services, such as Amazon Web Services. These service providers are authorized to use Observation Data only for the purpose of providing services to Factual.    Factual’s affiliates and joint venture partners.  Factual will share Observation Data with its affiliates, strategic business partners and joint venture partners as necessary to operate or enhance Factual’s business.    Acquirer or merger entity  In the event that Factual is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or is potentially going to be acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, in any partial or total sale of assets including in the event of bankruptcy, or in any other corporate change, Factual may transfer or assign Observation Data as part of that actual or potential merger corporate change.    Other   Factual will disclose Observation Data if it believes it will help protect Factual, its Customers, or any other person or third party, or to enforce any legal rights.      6. How long does Factual retain Observation Data?  Factual may retain Observation Data not subject to GDPR: (a) as needed to provide its services for up to 24 months from the date of last observation; and, (b) for other business purposes (including technical developments, legal, accounting, auditing, or bug-detection and prevention) for such period as Factual considers reasonably necessary to protect its legal or business interests.  Factual may retain data beyond the foregoing time periods if required by law.  For data subject to GDPR, please see More information for individuals in the EEA .  7. U.S. Consumer opt-out  In the United States, the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) have established rules about interest-based advertising including cross-device linking for such advertising. Interest-based advertising is digital advertising that is tailored to Consumers’ inferred interests, preferences, and locations. Cross-device linking is the practice of associating different browsers and/or devices (such as mobile devices and televisions) based on information about the likely relationships among them.  Factual may use or transfer Observation Data for interest-based advertising including cross-device linking. Factual is a member of the NAI and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct as described on the NAI website . Factual also adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles as described on the DAA website .  Opting out of advertising services by Factual  Factual provides Consumers the ability to opt-out of the collection and use of mobile app data by Factual across apps over time on a device for interest-based advertising purposes (including cross-device linking for such purposes), and for ad delivery and reporting purposes, through the DAA’s AppChoices tool.  To exercise this opt-out, a Consumer can download the AppChoices app onto the relevant mobile device and opt-out through the app. When a Consumer opt-outs as to Factual on a particular device, Factual will also stop using and transferring mobile app data from that device for interest-based advertising and ad delivery/reporting on other linked devices. Additionally, when a Consumer opts-out as to Factual on a particular device, Factual will stop using mobile app data coming in from other linked devices for interest-based advertising and ad delivery/reporting to the device from which choice was exercised.  AppChoices is available at these links:   DAA AppChoices iOS  DAA AppChoices Android  DAA AppChoices Amazon   Please note that Consumers who use more than one mobile device should renew their opt-out choices on each device.  Consumers who opt-out from use of their data as part of Factual’s Services may continue to receive interest-based advertising from other companies. Additionally, Factual may continue to collect, use, and transfer mobile app data for purposes other than interest-based advertising or ad delivery/reporting.  Opting out of interest-based advertising by Factual’s Customers and suppliers  In addition to the links above for mobile opt-outs, to opt-out of web-viewing information collection for interest-based advertising by companies that participate in the NAI or the DAA, visit NAI’s opt-out page or DAA’s Consumer Choice Page .  8. Particular U.S. segment disclosures  The NAI requires members to disclose standard interest segments based on health- and wellness-related interests and information, or based on political information or interests, that are used to deliver interest-based advertisements in the United States.  Factual provides Customers with such standard segments to deliver interest-based advertisements and for other purposes; our health segments are based on data that is not considered sensitive under the NAI Code of Conduct. For a list of our standard health and political segments, please click here .  9. More information for individuals in the EEA  We will use “GDPR” to refer to the General Data Protection Regulation and UK and Swiss equivalents and, as mentioned above, we will use “EEA” to refer to the European Economic Area, the UK and Switzerland.  a. When Factual is a data controller, what is our legal basis for processing?     POI Data   Factual processes POI Data that is subject to GDPR when it is in Factual’s interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by the data subjects’ data protection rights. These legitimate interests include giving Customers a reliable set of business and other locations to use in their own services and enabling Factual to determine the businesses and other locations that a device has visited.     Observation Data   Factual processes Observation Data based on consent.  As Factual does not collect Observation Data directly from Consumers, it requires its suppliers to provide transparent disclosures and collect consent on Factual’s behalf.        b. How long does Factual, as a data controller, retain data that is subject to GDPR?  To the extent that any POI Data is subject to GDPR, Factual may retain POI Data for as long as Factual has a legitimate interest and this interest is not overridden by the data subjects’ data protection rights.  Factual may retain Observation Data: (a) as needed to provide its services for up to 36 months from the date of collection; and, (b) for other business purposes (including technical developments, legal, accounting, auditing, or bug-detection and prevention) for such period as Factual considers reasonably necessary to protect its legal or business interests (usually up to 6 years).  Factual may retain data beyond the foregoing time periods if required by law.  c. E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield  Factual complies with the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland. Factual certifies that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.  Factual is accountable for information that it receives under Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party, including third-parties that Factual engages to process this information on its behalf.

Accept by checking the box.   Send Feedback Form   Malkodet      Thanks for your feedback!                Accessibility Statement  We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of circumstance and ability.  To fulfill this promise, we aim to adhere as closely as possible to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us provide a site that is accessible to all people, from the blind to the motor impaired.  This website utilizes various technologies all meant to make it more accessible. We utilize an interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs. This interface replace s the older fashioned method of providing all users with the same, lesser but accessible design or user interface.  Here are some of the interface’s capabilities:   Font handling -  users can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust spacing, alignment, line height, and more.  Color handling - users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over 7 different coloring options.  Animations – e pileptic users can stop all running animations in an instant, at the click of a button. Those animations include videos, GIFs and CSS flashing transitions.  Content highlighting – users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements specifically.  Audio muting – users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire  website instantly.  Cognitive disorders – we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.  Other options – we provide users the option to change cursor color and sizing, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard and much more..   Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level every 24 hours. This AI engine remediates the website’s HTML issues, as well as functionality and behavior, to the use of blind people that are using screen readers, and the motor impaired that are using a keyboard to operate websites.  We utilize AI for the following accessibility components:   Screen-reader optimization: The AI runs in the background and learns the website’s components top to bottom, thereby providing screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, it will provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the AI scans all of the website's images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, click the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn adjustments on as soon as they enter the website.  Keyboard navigation optimization: The AI adjusts the website’s HTML, as well as adding various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website fully operable by a keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the entire site using the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with ESC, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key, and more. Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus (available at any time by clicking Alt+1). The AI will also handle triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and It’ll not let the focus drift outside of it, for best orientation.   Browser and Assistive Technology Compatibility:  We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all the modern, major and popular systems that comprise over 95% of the users’ market share and include: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, Microsoft Edge and I.E 11 or above, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users. This website is operable using other systems and platforms as well, though we are not officially supporting them and recommend users to utilize the aforementioned.  Notes, Comments, and Feedback:  Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, it is possible that there will still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are constantly improving the accessibility interface, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, at any time and in accordance with technological advancements.  If you’ve discovered a bug or malfunction, if you find any aspect of the interface difficult to use, or if you have improvement ideas, we’ll be happy to hear from you. Simply click on the “Feedback” button at the bottom of the interface, and fill out the feedback form. Alternatively, you can send an email to our web accessibility team using the following form If you wish to speak with the website owner directly, please contact our team and we’ll provide you with their contact information (we do not publish this information due to data collection and misuse conducted by spambots).
