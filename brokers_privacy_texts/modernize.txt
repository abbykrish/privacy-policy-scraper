The specific pieces of personal information Modernize has collected about you during the 12 months before your request.   Consumer Request that Personal Information be Deleted  You have the right to request that Modernize delete any personal information about you that Modernize has collected. However, Modernize will not be required to comply with your request if one or more of the exceptions set forth in California Civil Code section 1798.105(d) apply:   The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information in order to complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated within the context of abusiness’s ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer.  The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity.  The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information to debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.  The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information to exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.  The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.  The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information to engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the businesses’ deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if the consumer has provided informed consent.  The business must maintain the consumer’s personal information to enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer’s relationship with the business. The business must maintain the consumer’s information to comply with a legal obligation.  The business must maintain the consumer’s information to otherwise use it, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.   Methods for Submitting Requests  You may make the above requests by calling toll free at (888) 219-1908 or making such request at inquiry@modernize.com . Please note that you may only make a personal information request twice in a 12-month period, Modernize may need personal information from you to verify your identify in order to process the request, and Modernize will respond to you within 45 days of receiving your request.  Anti-Discrimination  Modernize will not discriminate against you because you exercised your rights under California Civil Code section 1798.100, et seq., including, but not limited to, by:   Denying goods or services to you.  Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.  Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.  Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.   New York Nuisance Act    Modernize and its agents must inform consumers on a call that the consumer can request that his or her number be added to Modernize’s internal do not call list. If the customer does so, the agent must immediately end the call and add the number to the list or cause the number to be added to the list.   Modernize call scripts should be modified, if necessary, in order to comply with this requirement.    Modernize can’t sell or transfer customer contact information without express agreement in writing or electronic format.   By obtaining consent through its landing pages, Modernize is complying with this requirement. I also believe that obtaining consent via voice recording should qualify as a “writing” for purposes of this new law, as it does under the E-Sign Act for purposes of the TCPA—but note that there is not yet a definitive answer under the New York Nuisance Call Act on this issue.    Modernize must preserve call/consent records for two years.  Modernize already complies with this requirement in order to comply with the TCPA.   Do Not Call Policy   Modernize takes its responsibilities about customer information and customer service very seriously. In support of this commitment, Modernize has adopted the following Do Not Call Policy.  No employee or agent of Modernize shall engage in telemarketing practices that violate the terms of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the FTC Telephone Sales Rule, or state law or regulation.  Modernize maintains a record of the name and telephone number for consumers who do not wish to be called. If you don’t want to receive sales calls from Modernize, just ask us to place your name on our Do Not Call List. We will note your request immediately, and will remove your information from active lists within 30 days.  You can make your request in writing by mailing us at 804 Congress Avenue, Suite 400, Austin, TX 78701 or by phone by calling 1-888-565-1613. When you make a request you must include your name, address and telephone number(s) you want to be included on our list. If your information changes, please notify us of the new name, address, and telephone number(s) in order to remain on our Do Not Call List. If you would like us to remove you from our Do Not Call List in order to receive our telephone solicitations, notify us by contacting us at the above address or telephone number.  All Modernize personnel involved with telemarketing and/or telephone solicitation for Modernize are trained, informed, and directed to comply with Modernize Do Not Call Policy.
