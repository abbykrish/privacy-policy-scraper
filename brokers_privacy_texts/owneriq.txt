Your privacy is a top priority at ownerIQ.  This privacy notice governs and details the main privacy principles we apply to the data we collect through our ad tech services.  To access our privacy notice governing our corporate website only, please scroll down to the Website Privacy Notice paragraph or click here.    About ownerIQ’s services  At ownerIQ, we collect data about the products and services that people own, use or have shown interest in, and use that data to help advertisers and publishers (websites and mobile apps that provide products, services, content and media) provide relevant advertising and content to those people as they browse the internet or utilize an app on a mobile device. For example, if you visit and browse on Website/mobile application A, on a subsequent online visit to Website/mobile application B, you may see ads personalized by your browsing history on Website/mobile application A.  This is called Interest Based Advertising.  For more information on how it works, please click here.       Generally speaking, we collect, use and share data to recognize consumers across different channels and platforms over time for the purpose of facilitating tailored advertising, analytics, attribution, ad fraud detection, and reporting. With our service, you should receive advertisements that are more relevant to you, based on current browsing and buying behavior, than the standard advertising you would receive otherwise.   Services like ours also enable your favorite blogs for free, and keep your favorite stores in business, including small businesses who have small advertising budgets that need to be efficient and reach the right potential customers.                  Data Collection and Use  We collect and use browsing and purchase data to serve online ads.  The data we use in delivering the tailored online ad is tied to a specific device, but does not, by itself, identify a specific individual. We focus on using data that indicates products and services that people own, use or have shown an interest in.        See more       We identify specific events that occur prior to a consumer purchase or taking a desired action on an advertiser’s ad campaign. We use such data to focus an ad campaign on consumers who browse in similar patterns online.  The data we collect is used to increase the relevancy of the ads being displayed to your device, along with analytics, attribution and reporting purposes, to give our customers and partners more information about the performance of their advertising campaign and to improve performance over time.  We use browsing and purchase data  To serve relevant ads, we single out patterns of general purchase behavior but we do not willingly use data that would identify a particular individual (such as name, phone number, address, etc.) in delivering the online ad. Through our pixel on our customers’ websites, we collect and use data related to your device’s browsing activity, through cookies and statistical identifiers.  We also collect and use mobile advertising identifiers (such as Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID, also known as Google Advertising ID).Through our technology, we record:   Events related to your device’s activity on our customers' websites (such as the number of pages viewed, the products viewed, date and time of browsing, products purchased (optional)).  Information related to your device (browser type, device type, operating system, version, IP address*).  Events related to our ad serving activity such as the number of ads displayed to your device, and ads clicked.   The above list is referred to as device-identified information (DII). It identifies a particular device but not a particular individual. DII is sometimes described as pseudonymous data.  Note: *In compliance with industry standards, we use full IP addresses:   For fraud detection purposes to help alert us to situations which could not have been caused by human behavior, such as a massive amount of clicking in a limited period of time; or  To extract geographical information.   We may also collect technical identifiers from our advertising partners for the purpose of linking browsers (“ID syncing”). For that purpose, we process and store:   Technical IDs of our advertising partners, and/or a hashed version of your CRM ID, your email address, or your phone number.  We use a hashing method to turn your email address/CRM ID/phone number into a series of characters that does not identify you individually.  For example, a hash of jsmith@example.com would be 765D64036CC8EC496F31DD0C242DBECA.  Mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple IDFA or Google Ad ID) which are specific technical data created by mobile manufactures to allow personalization and customer analytics in a secure and non-identifying way for users.  Mobile advertising IDs are resettable and/or limited by the Limit Ad Tracking option in the device settings.   Optionally, our customers can provide purchase data from their point of sale systems (“POS”). POS data is used after it is transformed into DII (e.g., tied to a cookie ID). It is then used to inform tailored advertising, analytics, and ad delivery and reporting.  Data from trusted partners  We may use a combination of basic, publicly available demographic data points to place device IDs into pre-defined market segments, such as “middle-income renters without children” or “middle-income, middle-aged homeowners and renters with children.”  These segments consist of groups of households with similar demographic and life-stage characteristics.  We may also receive device-identified information from other sources. For example, we might receive data from a third party that indicates that in a geographic area, a certain model of car is popular and therefore people located in that general area might be interested in an ad for similar cars. We combine this information with the information we collect directly.  Audience Matched Advertising  As discussed in the section above, some of our customers may contribute personally identified information ("PII") from their Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") software, such as name, address, email address, phone number, and associated transactional information. CRM data may reflect online or offline interactions with a particular advertiser, publisher or retailer. We use a combination of our technology and LiveRamp’s technology to convert the PII to a device identified identifier before being used in providing advertising to your device. For more information about LiveRamp’s services, you can visit the LiveRamp Privacy Policy . Our customers acquire and use this data on our platform to understand which kinds of households or individuals are likely to be interested in their products and services, to deliver online ads to those customers and prospects, and to further refine and improve their advertising campaigns or the advertising campaigns of the brands which sell through their retail stores.  This is also called Audience-Matched Advertising, which is the practice of using data linked, or previously linked, to Personally-Identified Information (e.g., email address, phone number) for the purpose of tailoring advertising on one or more unaffiliated websites or mobile applications, or on devices, based on preferences or interests known or inferred from such data.  We use and may disclose CRM data along with information such as purchase data in order to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and for other reporting and analytic purposes.  Data we do not collect or use  We do not collect hardware-based identifiers such as universal device identifier (UDID) or Mac address.  We do not use sensitive data (such as sensitive health information generally regarded by most people as sensitive), certain aspects of a user’s personal life or financial situation (such as credit, insurance or employment eligibility), or use of, or interest in pornographic or otherwise obscene “adult” products or services for interest based advertising. You can review our standard health segments here.  We do not create segments to specifically target children under 16 years old.  Our pixel platform is set to not collect personal data from devices which appear to be physically located in the European Economic Area (EEA).  In other words, if your device appears to be located in the EEA, our technology will not place an interest-based advertising cookie ID or other similar identifier.  We may create aggregated data  We aggregate general consumer data and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and other purposes. We also disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, the general browsing behavior we see online shows 15% purchased TVs during the holiday season) in order to describe our services to prospective customers and partners, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.                      The Technology - How We Collect Data  ownerIQ collects data via technical cookies placed on your computer browser and mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID, also known as Google Advertising ID) in environments that do not support tailored advertising cookies, such as mobile apps.        See more       Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Tailored Ad Technologies  We “tag” visitors to websites which have our pixel embedded with browser cookies. Visitors tagged by us are given a technical ID (a random string of numbers and letters). We do not store or use personally identified information, such as name or address, in the cookie or with the technical identifier used to deliver the online ad.  The browser cookies track the products viewed by the visitor and the page visit of the advertiser for whom we are delivering ads. Pixels are used to transfer browsing and purchase data from visitors of the websites with our pixel to our servers.  A cookie is a small text file that contain a string of characters and uniquely identifies a browser. Cookies are used by websites to recognize a computer they have encountered before. Most of the websites you visit use cookies to enhance the user experience on those sites.  A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon, transparent GIFs, or web bugs) is an often-transparent graphic image that is placed on a website that allows tracking of general user traffic patterns.  Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies.  Mobile Advertising Identifiers (e.g., Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Ad ID) are unique IDs that are associated with an individual mobile device and do not reveal your real world identity.  They are user-resettable and/or limited by the Limit Ad Tracking function in the mobile settings.  Statistical identifiers (sometimes referred to as non-cookie technologies) are created via an algorithm using pseudonymous information about your computer or device, including the operating system, user-agent string, IP address, Internet browser, and similar information.  This information makes your computer or device distinct enough for systems to determine within a reasonable probability that they are encountering the same computer or device, including in environments where our cookies are not supported.  These statistical identifiers are not 100% accurate.  Our customers’ advertisements are displayed on websites, also known as “publishers,” which usually provide free or low cost services, content and media.  These publishers may also place cookies on your browser.  These cookies are there so the publishers recognize that we have placed a tailored advertisement available for your browser.  We work with ad exchange platforms to buy ad placements through auctions.  Before the auction, we link our ID with the ad exchange platform and then participate in the auction by sending the bid price and the banner code to display.  We may place ads on websites that are part of the Google Display Network.  Based on your visits to these websites, Google uses an advertising cookie from DoubleClick to associate your browser with interest and demographic categories.  Google then uses these categories for tailored advertising on these websites.  To learn more about this and your choices from Google, please click here.  Cross-Device Mapping  Cross-device mapping is the process of making inferences that certain devices are related to each other, i.e. they belong to the same user or household.  This is done using either “statistical” or “deterministic” methods (or a combination).  “Statistical” refers to using mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses that certain devices are related.  “Deterministic” means using known relationships, for example logins that use the same email address or other personal information, to link multiple devices to a single user.  When this method is used, companies typically mask the actual email address (e.g., hashing it).  For tailored advertising, and ad delivery and reporting, we use a combination of our own cross-device mapping technology and Tapad’s cross-device technology. This means we try to identify when a consumer has seen our tailored ad on one device and then purchases the item or service from the ad on another device. This also means that information about your online browsing data on one device may be combined with data from your other devices. Tapad may use this information to improve its products and services. Tapad may share information with other companies regarding the connections among your devices. For more information about how Tapad uses cross-device information, please visit the Tapad Privacy Policy.  Audience Matched Advertising  As described in the previous section, our customers may also provide their CRM data via secured transfers (e.g., SFTP method or hashed identifiers).  Once this data is onboarded to an online identifier, the online identifier interacts with the adtech ecosystem with cookies and mobile ad IDs, as we’ve described.                         Data Sharing  As described in “The Technology - How We Collect Data,” our technology interacts with several other companies to perform services to deliver online ad campaigns. Below are the categories of recipients which data may be shared.        See more       Supply-side platforms  Our ads are placed on websites and mobile apps which have ad space available for programmatic auction.  This is often called “Real Time Bidding.”  To do this, we must synchronize the identifiers we use with those used by these auctions in order to participate in the auction by sending our bid and the advertising we wish to display.  This means we must send the identifier we use to recognize your device to these the companies involved in these auctions.  Data platforms  Some advertisers use data platforms (e.g., “Data Management Platforms”) which facilitates the implementation of audience segmentation and communicates it to online advertising industry companies like us. These communications require the synchronization of the identifiers we use with those used by this platform.  Demand Side Platforms  Some advertisers use our audience segments on other demand side platforms ("DSP") to bid and deliver ads in the RTB system. This requires us to synch our identifier with those DSPs to send the audience segments for use in the advertisers’ ad campaigns.  Companies allowing us to match several identifiers  In order to more effectively associate our identifiers (e.g., cookie ID, mobile ad ID), we may need to transfer the identifier we have assigned to your browser. We also may transfer CRM data (as described in the section above) to facilitate the identity matching. This combination of our identifiers allows us to offer you a consistent experience regardless of the environment you are browsing, as well being able to provide more accurate reporting to advertisers on how many devices saw the ad and resulted in a view or purchase.  Companies allowing us to fight fraud  We provide limited data to anti-fraud companies to enable them to effectively detect and report fraudulent activity to us.  Companies allowing us to locate your device generally  We may transmit your IP address to companies which can deduct from it information that is not specific to your exact coordinates but the general area (country, region, city, over 500m).  Other companies our customers have retained  Some of our customers may ask us to exchange some data with other companies they’ve retained through the ads we serve for the purposes compatible with the purpose of delivering personalized advertisements (e.g., to measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns).  Our parent corporation and affiliates  We may transfer data to our parent corporation and affiliates for processing in accordance with this notice for the purposes of our services. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose all or part of its data in the event of a merger, acquisition, dissolution or sale of all or part of its assets. You will then be informed by email and/or by a message on our website of any change in ownership or regarding the use of your data and the rights you will have over them.  Service Providers  We may share data with our service providers who process it on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions. This may include, for example, providers in tech support, operations, web or data hosting, billing, accounting, security, marketing, data management, validation, enhancement or hygiene, or otherwise assisting us to provide, develop, maintain and improve our services.  Any recipient necessary to comply with legal, regulatory, judicial or administrative obligations  In some situations, we may disclose data in response to legal requests from authorities, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, investigate a case of fraud or respond to a request from the government.                          OPTING OUT  If you do not want to receive ads displayed by us based on your browsing and purchasing behavior, you can opt out as described below.  European Economic Area: Please note we do not place cookies, or other persistent device identifiers, on devices which appear to be physically located in the European Economic Area.  You do not need to opt out – your device is not in our systems. If you click “Opt Out,” you may receive an error message due to your device not being recognized by our systems.  Safari (i.e., Apple browser) and Firefox: Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature and browser settings in Firefox may prevent the opt out from functioning properly.  To opt out and/or check your opt out status please click here.  To opt out of Audience Matched Advertising with an email address, please click here.  To opt out of Audience Matched Advertising with a phone number, please click here.         See more       Online web browser environment  When you select “Opt Out”, we will place a “blank” or “blocking” cookie on your browser.  We must maintain the opt out cookie on your browser in order to recognize you as having opted out from our service.  You must opt out again if you clear that cookie from a browser, or use a new device or browser to access the internet.  Selecting “Opt Out” means the advertising you receive from ownerIQ will not be personalized, i.e., not based on your device’s browsing activity.  You will still see advertising everywhere you normally would.  It will also not impact cookies or tracking which may be on your browser from other sites.  Please note that if you are using an ad-blocker, you may have to pause blocking or whitelist our website.  The Ghostery browser extension is also a good tool to see a list of all third-party cookies on each website you visit and allows you to selectively opt out. You can opt out of ownerIQ through the Ghostery browser extension.  You can also opt out through industry opt out platforms: NAI opt out platform, DAA opt out platform, or DAAC (Canada) opt out platform. The industry opt out platforms offer one place to review and opt out of any or all of its members.  Note: The industry opt out platforms are not additional steps for opting out of ownerIQ; just additional ways to opt out.  As described above, we elected to provide mechanisms of choice through our opt out and through industry platforms and do not respond to web browser do not track signals.  Mobile app environment  Within a mobile device like a smartphone or tablet, the web browser environment and in-app environment are separate.  If you do not want to receive ownerIQ tailored ads whatever environment browsed, you must disable our services for both the online web browser (as in the previous section) and mobile app environments.  For tailored ads in the mobile app environment, you can opt out by clicking on the opt out button accessible through the AdChoices icon integrated into our ads.  You can also opt out by downloading DAA AppChoices mobile app ( Google Play Store or Apple App Store ) and selecting ownerIQ.  Please note: The procedures described above will only opt out of tailored ads that are displayed by ownerIQ.  If you want to disable other services, please refer to your operating system settings, or follow instructions below:  You can typically opt out at the mobile platform level by the limit ad tracking within the settings function, as described below.  Android Users  To use the “opt-out of interest-based advertising” option, follow the instructions provided by Google here: Google Play Help.  Please note that this is a device setting and will disable interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for ownerIQ.  iOS users (version 6 and above)  To use the “Limit Ad-Tracking” option, follow the instructions provided by Apple here: Apple Support Center.  Please note that this is a device setting and will disable interest-based ads from all providers, not just for ownerIQ.  Cross-Device Mapping  As described above in “Data Collection and Use,” we use a combination of our own technology and Tapad’s technology to link devices in a non-personally identifying way. To learn more, please visit Tapad’s Privacy Policy. While opting out on one device may opt out of all devices we have connected to our identifier, our device mapping is not 100%. Therefore, to ensure opt out all of your connected devices, you must follow the opt out instructions for each device.  AUDIENCE-MATCHED ADVERTISING  As described above in " Data Collection and Use, " our technology sometimes uses previously linked Personally Identified Information and connects to an online identifier. To opt out of the use of your email address as an onboarded PII, please click here and select ownerIQ from the industry opt-out platform and follow the instructions.  To opt out of the use of your phone number as an onboarded PII, please click here and follow the instructions.  NAI also provides additional guidance on all your opt out options.                           CALIFORNIA RIGHTS AND CHOICES  This section supplements the information in this Privacy Notice and applies solely to California residents as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).        See more       Personal Information is broadly defined under CCPA as information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular person or device.  Applied to ownerIQ, this means our device identified information is also included in CCPA’s definition of personal information.  Our collection, use, purpose, and sharing of personal information under CCPA are described in other parts of this Privacy Notice.  The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.  You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or deletion twice within a 12-month period.  RIGHT TO OPT OF SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  The CCPA broadly defines what constitutes as a “sale” – including making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration,” which is not limited to “monetary consideration.”  Depending on what information we have about you, and whether we have included any of it in our products and services, we may have sold (as defined by the CCPA) certain categories of information about you in the last 12 months.  RIGHT TO DELETION  California residents have the right to request deletion of personal information we have collected from you and retained.  Please note that this is different from your right to “opt out” of us selling your personal information, which is described above.  Also note we do not generally collect personal information directly from consumers.  Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete, as applicable) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.  We may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or (g) to comply with legal obligations.  RIGHT TO ACCESS  California residents have the right to request we disclose what categories of personal information we collect, use, disclose or sell.  You may also request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.  If we are able to verify your identity and provide back personal information as requested, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information.  If we are unable to verify your identity, we will inform you we cannot verify your identity and we will not disclose any specific pieces of personal information to you.  EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS  California residents may exercise their CCPA rights by:  If you would like to opt out of the sale of your personal information, you may do so through the DAA CCPA Opt Out Tools. You can opt out via both website and mobile app as described in the DAA CCPA Opt Out Tools.  For deletion and access requests, click on this link to generate the ownerIQ identifier connected to your device, and then fill out this form , including the ownerIQ identifier.  You can also contact us at 844-392-1073.  For security purposes (and as required by the CCPA), we will verify your identity when you request to exercise your right to access or deletion. Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:   Where you have requested the categories of personal information we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.  Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern in doing so.  Where you have requested we delete personal information we have collected from you, we will seek to confirm whether your request is for an “opt out of sale” or a “deletion”. This is because “opt out of sale” rights enable us to maintain your information for “suppression” purposes (i.e., to prevent us from selling information about you in the future). This is what many consumers requesting “deletion” actually desire to occur. We explain this in order to ensure we are meeting consumers’ preferences. In addition, “deletion” rights only apply to information we have collected “from” consumers –which does not apply to much of the information in our databases.  Upon completion of the above process, we will send you a notice that explains the categories of personal information we were able to locate about you, and whether we (1) deleted, (2) de-identified, or (3) retained the information we collected from you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.   If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you with additional information about the reasons we could not comply with your request.  Note about Authorized Agents: You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA as described above.  We will take steps both to verify your identity (as the consumer), and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney. We cannot provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you or the California resident whose identity has also been verified.                      ownerIQ Commitments and Adherence  We support transparency and control for consumers.
