Below is a brief description of rights that may apply to you:     4.1 Right of access   You may have the right to access your personal information to review, update, and correct inaccuracies. There are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information we will provide access to. For example, in some cases, we may limit access to personal information where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of the requests have been repetitive in character, or where doing so would violate the rights of others.   4.2 Right to information   In some circumstances and subject to certain exceptions, you may have the right to request information about the processing of your information. Information typically requested includes: The categories or specific types of personal information we have collected. The business purpose for collecting, disclosing, and/or selling the information. The sources from which personal information was collected. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. The criteria used to determine the time that personal information will be held. The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling that uses your personal information. The safeguards we’ve applied to protect your information when it is transferred internationally.   4.3 Right to rectification   You may have the right to ask us to rectify personal information you think is inaccurate.
